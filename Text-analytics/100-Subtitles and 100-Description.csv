1,Human-headed Pot,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. Like you, it's from Earth, literally from the ground.   Yet for thousands of years, it's been like this — frozen in time, gazing up at the sky. What is it doing?   Keeping its chin up? Facing the challenges of life?   Or does it represent a more elevated ambition? Is this the first stargazer?   Maybe it's both. 7,000 years old, the legacy of the Yangshao culture, it dates from the Neolithic period, the new Stone Age — a time when people began to make elegant ground, polished stone tools instead of crude functional ones to farm and live together in settled communities.   In short, to lay the foundations of civilized existence. Pottery, the art, the craft of transforming clay, essentially dirt, by means of hands and fire, was an accidental discovery that had been made tens of thousands of years earlier.   It was a momentous one, full of potent symbolism. By playing with mud, humanity suddenly came of age, discovered the power of creation by a process as bright and hot as the Sun itself.   Cold, heavy clay, the dirt into which all living things decayed became something. A new age had dawned, one of speculation on the big issues of life — death, and humanity's place in the cosmos.   In fact, this jar is just one of many perplexing and seemingly perplexed faces that stare back at us across the Gulf of time. Heralds of the birth of culture, of human civilization.   But what of this one? Who is it?   What does it mean? It's hard to say for certain, even its gender, while the upturned lips innocently imploring suggests the child.   The rotund body of the actual jar suggests a sexually mature woman. It's a symbolically pregnant combination, literally.   A spout of the jar is an oval-shaped mouth and two squinting eyes. So narrow, that it was surely made to serve ritual rather than practical purposes.   Water, life force, flowing with difficulty for mother to child, culminating in the tears of mother and child alike that accompanied the arrival of the new life. Whatever its meaning, whatever its purpose, 6000 years have passed, the flesh-and-blood people who created it have vanished   Their village is gone, their rituals forgotten. But here, it still is permanent, as the earth that came from, as unchanging as the heavens above, the feelings of its creators captured forever.   People who suffer the pangs of birth faced up to the struggles of life and gazed in wonder at the Stars. People just like us.",RV-3041-1,Pot,"This pot has emerged completely undamaged - after more than 4,000 years in the ground. The almost completely round pot has a remarkably thin wall. The potter painted four swirling spirals with mineral dyes. A band of garlands forms the separation from the unpainted lower part. The upper part is smoothly polished, making the decoration extra noticeable. Fragments of red pottery were found during excavations in 1921 near the town of Yangshao in Henan province. In the years that followed, similar pottery was found in numerous places in northern China among other remains of prehistoric settlements. These date from the period between the fifth and second millennium BC. After the first site, the settlements are given the collective name Yangshao culture complex.
This pot was recovered from a prehistoric cemetery in the Banshan Hills in southern Gansu province. The Chinese name for these pots is 'guan'. Filled with provisions, they were given as grave goods to the dead."
2,Jiahu Bone Flute,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   9,000 years ago, a crane took flight for the last time.   Yet, though this bird would never fly again, he would, in a sense, sing again, and in so doing, open up a new chapter in history.   Whether inspired by the eerie wailing of the other cranes, we don't know; but whoever gathered up the bones of the dead crane did something amazing.   Of course, with its crude mouthpiece and misaligned finger holes, its rather rudimentary.   But it's the flash of genius behind it that counts.   Here we have an archetype, the ancestor of the Chinese flute.   Ding XiaoKui is playing a copy of that bone flute.   The original was discovered at Jiahu in Hunan Province. 9,000 years ago, the site of a prehistoric settlement.   Between 1986 and 1987, more than 20 bone flutes were unearthed here.   The oldest musical instruments so far found in China.   We can only guess why these bone flutes were first made.   Most likely they were originally hunting decoys, used to mimic the sounds made by birds in order to lure prey.   Perhaps the sounds they made became associated over time.   With a thrill of the hunt, music was born.   One especially interesting feature of the Jiahu Bone Flutes is that they developed and improved, whilst the earliest examples had five finger holes, later ones — seven or eight.   This has a very significant implication, far from being restricted to the five note pentatonic scale.   As was once believed, the early Chinese music might have been based on a seven note scale, like the one we use today.   And even the misaligned finger holes suggest common ground with modern-day music, working out where an irregularly shaped piece of material like a wing bone to make the holes must have been a matter of trial and error, as it still is even for today's top flute tuners.   9,000 years on, what were once hunters decoys have metamorphosed into instruments of pleasure and artistic expression.   And in the hands of modern Chinese artists like Ding XiaoKui, these musical instruments unheard for thousands of years are singing once again.   New life breathed into a long-forgotten tradition, just as 9,000 years ago, our ancestors breathed life into the dead bone of a bird and produced the sound.   The first faint cry of a civilization about to be born.",RV-1070-238,Guitar,"moon guitar, ... ..., yue-ch'in

3,Pottery Eagle-shaped Tripod,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   All pottery is unique.   Each piece, no matter how humble, undergoes a series of trials, dragged kicking and screaming from the clay, pressed and molded into shape, fired.   Only when it has survived these rites of passage does it become permanent, an object in its own right.   But there's one piece of Chinese pottery, this may be more special than any other.   It's a cauldron in the shape of a hawk, just one of many unearthed ceramic objects attributed to the Neolithic Yangshao Culture.   It's special because unlike most other examples of Yangshao pottery, it serves no obvious functional purpose.   Questions abound: what was it for?   Holding water? Storing food? Or did it serve a ritual purpose?   Why is it shaped like a bird?   To date, nothing else quite like it has been found.   So scholars and researchers are sure to continue debating these questions.   But maybe there's another possibility, that it was purely decorative.   6,000 years ago, Chinese pottery had transcended the practical and function, and acquired an artistic aesthetic dimension.   Keke is a Potter.   She's especially keen on ancient animal-shaped pots like these.   She's going to try to make a copy of the Hawk-shaped-cauldron.   But making a copy is about more than satisfying a whim.   After a gap of 6,000 years, there's no way of knowing exactly how this cauldron was made.   Making a new one will involve a lot of guesswork on Keke's part.   Guesswork that will cast light on how Master Potter's worked six millenia ago.   The actual receptacle of the cauldron is supported by two stout legs resting on clawed feet and a tail.   It's generously proportioned, perhaps hinting that a magnanimous heartbeats within the chest of this bird.   Overall, it's a curious composition: cute, noble, and severe, all at the same time.   In fact, it's the cuteness of the hawk that gives this ancient work of art a surprisingly modern and contemporary feel, showing just how exquisite craftsmanship can speak to us, move us, even after 6,000 years.   The Hawk-shaped-cauldron is more than a handful of clay from 6,000 years ago.   It's a vessel, overflowing with the water from the wellspring of Chinese civilization.   Perhaps more than any other, pottery is the art of time.   Leave clay too long, and it'll dry, and crack. Let it get too wet, it'll fall apart.   It's about knowing when, as much as what, how long to fire in the kiln; how long to let it cool down.   Living in an age when the pace of life has never been faster, the ancient craft of pottery has a lot to teach people today.   And maybe that's the message: the Hawk-shaped-cauldron has for us today: about the patience and care that went into its creation; a process that produced something of superb craftsmanship that endured for more than 6,000 years, and now gazes out at us from its perch in the National Museum of China.", RV-3463-1,Vessel,"This vessel is shaped like an owl. The head serves as a stop, the tail and the legs as a foot. The vessel was made as a grave gift in the Han period (206 BC - 221 AD). The red pottery contains remains of green and grayish glaze.

Grave goods have been given to the dead since earliest Chinese history. In the past, these were mainly real utensils and animals, and even servants buried alive. But in the Han period, pottery models were often used. Animal figures that were buried included statues of domestic animals, such as dogs, ducks and pigs, as well as animals with symbolic meaning. In China the owl is said to summon the soul of the dead."
4,Longshan Eggshell Black Pottery Cup,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   What do you think of when you hear the word ""thin""?   A butterfly's wing, the edge of a coin, a centimeter, a millimeter, or 0.2 millimeter?   Some four thousand years ago, along the banks of the Yellow River, the Longshan culture achieved something remarkable, a fusion of superb craftsmanship and a basic material.   Only a few products of this union have survived down to the present day — Eggshell Black Pottery Goblets.   Wherever you look, the emergence of culture and civilization has always been heralded by mastery of art of pottery.   But there's something different about the black pottery produced by the Longshan culture.   Across the archaeological community, there's a general consensus that nothing from the same period rivals Longshan Black Pottery Goblets in delicacy.   What's more, the various shapes and sizes of the black eggshell pottery goblets indicate they were not mass-produced articles.   It seems each one was individually handcrafted with painstaking skills.   In fact, the level of craftsmanship is such that it remains unrivaled to this very day.   It is hard to make pottery as thin as this, even using modern technology.   So how were they made?   No one knows for sure.   All we can say is that they were made on a potter's wheel, an extremely fast, accurate, and stable one.   Until the kilns and workshops that produced them are discovered, we can only marvel and imagine how these delicate works were produced 4,000 years ago.   It's possible to say more with certainty about the clay that was used.   Fine silt, deposited in ancient rivers and lakes.   Once carefully rinsed and washed, it became a material of extraordinary malleability and durability.   Part of the secret might also lie in the kilns used to fire them, the temperatures they could achieve, and the time these black eggshell pottery goblets spent inside them.   Firing almost certainly explains the color.   The technique known as ""sealed firing"" allows carbon molecules to penetrate the clay at high enough temperatures, thus coloring it before it's polished.   But however it was achieved, the effect is stunning.   A mysterious black metallic luster, that even today, after 4,000 years, evokes feelings of reverence and awe.   High-end products like these were certainly not for the mass market, so to speak.   So who were they for?   And what purpose did they serve?   The most likely explanation is that they were sacrificial vessels, the preserve of the elite ruling class, used to showcase and highlight power and status.   As it spread down the Yellow River, the pottery produced by the Longshan culture became even more sophisticated.   Underlying this improved technology and craftsmanship is an increasingly more sophisticated social order.   But pottery had a fatal drawback.   It was weak and brittle, but times were about to change.   A new material was on its way, one that would herald the arrival of a new age — bronze.",RV-3182-1,Pot,"This pot dates from the beginning of the Zhou period, c. 1100 BCE. It is hand-shaped from slate-grey clay, and fired without glaze. The three feet are shaped like breasts. Vertical and horizontal lines have been scratched into the clay as decoration."
5,Hongshan Jade Dragon,"You have a new message from an ancient treasure.   This mysterious work of jade art was discovered in Ongniud Qi in Inner Mongolia.   The nose is upturned, and the eyes slightly convex.   The main gives the impression for creature in flight.   The design is simple and elegant; the jade fine and smooth.   It's as if and still soaring on a wind that blew five thousand years ago.   The similar jade piece was discovered in the village of Tala in Sanxing; known as the first dragon of China, it is regarded as the archetypal ancient depiction of a dragon.   Both Jade Dragons were discovered near the city of Chifeng.   It was here in the Liaohe River Basin that Hongshan culture originated around 5,000 years ago.   It was a time of great intimacy between people and their natural environment, when life and spirit flowed freely between humans and nature.   The Jade works of Hongshan culture are plain, unadorned, and bulky.   The image of the Jade Dragon Ball has become a symbol of Hongshan culture.   Yet the Ball and Dragon-shaped pottery of Hongshan is predated by that of Xinglongwa; and images of dragons and tigers made from shells have been found in graves at Yangshao.   These cultures flourished in areas geographically far apart.   Yet all three present the common image of the dragon.   There's a combination of parts of several different creatures.   All things share a common origin.   This is true of China's ethnic groups.   The dragon is the symbol of the Chinese nation.   Every aspect of the life, but every Chinese person is like a scale on the Dragon's body.   Together, these scales shaped Chinese civilization.   So how did the Chinese Dragon come into being?   Various Jade pieces service footprints, which we can follow back through time.   The changes point to the aesthetic sensibilities of different eras.   The curled Jade rings resemble a baby in the womb.   They appear to be the earliest form of a dragon.   It's as if they are depicting the conception of life and of civilization.   Held up to the light, just as our ancestors might have done 5000 years ago, we can only marvel at the clarity and translucent.   The curved spine arching towards the sky, suggests an imminently and a flight through time.",RV-2236-3,Jade,"pendant

6,Lingjiatan Jade Plaque and Jade Turtle,"Some say it has something to do with astrology, some say it's a numerical trigram of numerical origin, others say it has something to do with calendars, and still others say it's the legendary Luoshu. All speculations point to the most sophisticated technology and culture of human prehistoric civilisation. The little-known Lingjiatan site in Anhui Province is deep in surprising discoveries. When unearthed, this exquisite jade plate was sandwiched between jade turtle shells, which should be a set of combination. The jade tortoise is divided into two parts: the dorsal armour and the abdominal armour, on which there are several holes corresponding to the left and right sides, and a small circle in the middle of the jade plate, which is accurately divided into eight parts by straight arrows, with four arrows pointing to the corners of the jade plate outside the large circle. On the surface of the jade tortoise and the jade plate, they seem to present us with the simplest numbers and directions. But when we really get to know it better, we realise that it is a complex mystery of the numbering and cosmic system. Both pieces of jade tortoise armour have holes drilled into them, with the back of the tortoise counting eight and the belly counting five. If the top and bottom are stacked on top of each other, the middle is five and each side is four, which is consistent with the number of dorsal armour of a real tortoise. The eight directions on the jade plate indicate directions, with five holes on each side. Lingjiatan also unearthed six small jade figures, each in two tombs, all of which had their five fingers stretched out in front of their chests, which also seemed to express something. As we all have two hands, each of which has five numbers, Chinese culture, including the five elements, has adopted the pentad system by organically rearranging the numbers within 10. By organically rearranging and combining the numbers within 10, interesting numerical phenomena are produced. The method of change is to put one, two, three, four, five on the upper left and six, seven, eight, nine, ten on the lower right, which is Luoshu. Luo is the chakra, the law of the orderly functioning of the world. It is a state of extreme balance, in which all the numbers straight and diagonal lines add up to the same sum. There are nine holes drilled in the top of the jade plate, and four holes in the bottom that also fit into this number. This is why some believe it to be the source of the Luoshu, and others believe that the Jade Plate pioneered the Chinese numerical trigrams, the basis of abstract mathematics. The eight-pointed star symbol in the centre of the jade plate is also an ancient and interesting mystery. Until now, this symbol has been found in several ethnic groups in China, and even throughout many cultures around the world. These graphic symbols are like hidden codes of natural laws, but they have gradually been neglected and forgotten. The eight-pointed star pattern also appeared on the Lingjiadan jade eagle, of course, the magic of Lingjiadan is not only here, it also opens up a world of jade for us, Bijuan, battle-axe, adze, ring bracelet, penannular jade penannular, pipe beads and so on, already has a complete set of jade ritual scale. The wide range of cultural symbols covered by Lingjiatan and the depth of its origin are rare in the world. This is a peak of human culture, but an underestimated prehistoric civilisation. The total area of the Lingjiatan site is about 1.6 million square metres, and after five excavations, it only accounts for one eight-hundredth of the total area of the site. Perhaps in the near future, we may be shocked again by new discoveries.",RV-2670-2,Funeral statue,"This funerary figure of a turtle was given to a deceased person during the Han period (221 BC - 220 AD).

Grave goods have been given to the dead since earliest Chinese history. In the past, these were mainly real (utility) objects and animals, and even servants buried alive. Pottery models were often used in the Han period. The animal figures that were buried included domestic animals, such as dogs, ducks and pigs, but also animals with a symbolic meaning. The turtle is a sacred animal in China that rules the north. It symbolizes winter and long life."

8,Turquoise-inlaid Bronze Plaque,"You have a new message from an ancient treasure.  From angled sockets, two round eyes stare out, through 3,500 years of history.   But is it a dragon, or a tiger? A bull or a deer? An owl or a bear?   These eyes seem to be asking us the same question: who are you?   The bronze plaque is slightly convex.   Its inlaid with 300 tiny pieces of turquoise revealing a remarkable level of craftsmanship.   Predating written language in the region by 500 years, it conveys a wordless message: below the fields lies a city.   At its heart is a vast palace.   Some people believe this was the capital of the semi-mythical Xia dynasty.   This was the site of a vast bronze workshop.   The bronze age emerged relatively early in Western and Central Asia.   It was only later that small bronze vessels appeared in northwestern China, and at the time of Longshan culture on the central plains.   During the Erlitou era, bronze vessels were being made, that were of a far greater size than anything seen anywhere else in the world.   Among 200 vessels on earth that Erlitou is this ornamented sacrificial bronze Zun, the earliest object of its kind ever found in East Asia.   The spout, the handle, the three legs; it resembles early pottery vessels, except that it was cast in a new material: bronze.   The ability to forge metal alloys made the Erlitou culture the most advanced civilization of its time.   The bronze was first cast and then inlaid with the turquoise.   This union between metal and stone heralded a major advance by the bronze age in East Asia.   The pieces of turquoise were carved into triangles, hook shapes, trapezoids, strips, and circles.   The image they form is strange, revealing the contours of horns, a nose, eyes.   2,000 pieces of turquoise retreat the scales of a 70-centimeter-long dragon.   From deep sockets, a pair of bulging jade eyes cast a glance connecting heaven and earth.   The plaque would be laid on the chest of a dead person, accompanied by a bronze bell with a jade clapper.   Perhaps the fiery eyes of this mythical creature hurried the deceased on his way to the realm of his ancestors.   We've seen these eyes before at Tianshui in Gansu and Sanxing in Sichuan.   They are evidence of human interaction across thousands of miles, three millennia ago.   They cannot speak to us, but they don't need to.   Having witnessed China's first dynasty, these eyes are still watching as time passes.   我的笔记",RV-3927-1,Dagger,"This object most likely dates from the Shang-Yin period (1500-1100 BC). The rich decoration shows that the dagger had a ritual function. It was given as a grave gift to a prominent person.

Presumably the hilt was originally twice as large and contained a bronze dagger. The recesses were provided with colorful inlays, possibly made of mother of pearl, coral or turquoise. The decorations take the form of stylized, interlocking dragons and spirals. Such spirals are common on objects from early Chinese history and are called 'lei-wen'. There is a beautiful shine over the most raised parts. Here and there are pieces of caked soil that have dried."
9,Yinxu Turquoise-inlaid Oracle Bone,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. It's been knocked about a bit. That's to be expected after 2300 years.   Yet, scorched and battered though it undoubtedly is, on the whole, the ravages of time have been rather kind to the sheet of bronze. Look behind the dents and marks, and you can still make out the gold and silver lives of what might be the earliest surviving architectural drawing.   The plan of a proposed mausoleum for King Cuo, ruler of the state of Zhongshan, during the warring States Period. In fact, his existence is only known from inscriptions on these bronzes, which record that he dispatched troops to the state of Yan, helped put down an uprising.   The expedition was evidently successful and commemorated with a cauldron made from the spoils of war taken on the campaign. Located in what is now Hu of a province, sandwiched between two very powerful states, the affairs of her neighbors were very much Zhongshan's business in those turbulent times.   The bronze edging shows that King Cuo's ambitions weren't restricted to this life. Laid to rest in this palatial tomb complex, he would be a mighty king in death, too.   It was an ambitious scheme. The precise size and shape of each building, as well as the entire site, specified on this 96 by 48 centimeter drawing.   The drawings and plans are one thing, reality another. It's only when you take a look at the proposed site from the air that you start to get a real sense of what the King had in mind.   From his palatial tumb, Cuo would be at the center of this miniature kingdom of the dead. Sadly, perhaps, it was not meant to be — Zhongshan was destined to be wiped from the face of the earth.   Only the tombs of the king and his queen were ever completed. Poignant monuments to a king sported ambitions.   Gone, but not quite forgotten. 2,300 years later, the bronze is bearing Cuo's name resurfaced, a reminder of both of a long-forgotten footnote in the history of the warring States Period and the technological sophistication of ancient China.   What we see here is bronze of the finest quality, the work of a master craftsman with the most advanced broadcasting techniques at his fingertips. Stunningly decorated, it has a peculiarly contemporary feel to it.   Designed as a modular piece, the consists of individual parts ready to be disassembled, boxed up, taken away, at a moment's notice. This tiger is exquisitely well-observed.   The weight of the beast apparently displaced by the power of the bite inflicted on the frail fragile deer. It's also the ideal shape for a stand designed to support two fold-away screens.   These bronze tent fixtures are another good example of warring States modular design, a demonstration perhaps of just how important portability was back then. In a sense, these items embody the spirit of those times.   Invention born of necessity, flexibility essential, to surviving a ceaseless conflict of the warring States period. The time when for rulers and ruled alike, life was a constant battle, peace and repose only to be found in death.", RV-3883-1,Oracle,"The oldest forms of Chinese writing can be found on so-called oracle bones, fragments of animals, mainly shoulder blades of cattle and ventral shells of freshwater turtles, on which short texts have been scratched. They date mainly from the earliest period of Chinese history, the Shang dynasty (1500 - 1100 BC).

About 1900, Chinese scholars began studying the oracle bones. They discovered that some characters were precursors to today's Chinese script. This made it possible to decipher the writing and derive historical data from the texts. Things and people, until then only known from legends, turned out to have really existed.
The bones and shields were probably used in dowsing practices. They were heated until cracks and fractures appeared. On the basis of those cracks, a soothsayer made his predictions.
This fragment features an inscription consisting of various groups of characters. The bone dates from the Di Yi / Di Xin period and comes from the archaeological site of Yin Xu (Ruins of Yin)."
10,Houmuwu Ding,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. Almost 4000 years ago, the Shang Dynasty was at its zenith, the peak of its glory, an advanced civilization whose craftsmen were capable of producing truly spectacular pieces like this special cauldron — The Houmuwu Ding.   Weigh in at almost 900 kilograms, this is truly a humongous cauldron. An equally gargantuan smelter, as well as huge quantities of metal and an army of craftsmen, would have been needed to make it.   So how was this amazing piece of metal work accomplished? Experts disagree.   Some argue that marks on the cauldron suggest it was cast separately, then pieced together. Others think it was cast as a single piece with only the handles added later.   The varying thickness of the constituent parts would oppose to an additional challenge to the craftsmen who made it. It's quite possible that several attempts were made before this large cauldron was successfully cast.   Meanwhile, over in Europe, with the glory days of Greece and Rome still a very distant prospect, the use of bronze remain restricted to weapons and tools. But in China, it was a different story.   In addition to weapons and tools, Shang dynasty in China was capable of producing distinctly non-utilitarian items. For example, the Magnificent cauldrons associated with the sacrificial rituals that were so important in those days.   And the bigger they were, the better. But though ritual explains Shang Dynasty China's enthusiasm for big bronze, in general terms, why was The Houmuwu Ding made?   Scholars are divided. Most believe it was made for Fujing, wife of King Wu Dean.   Others meanwhile point to its similarity to things found in the tomb of Fuhao, another of his wives. Inscriptions on oracle bones mention these powerful women.   Quite apart from their relationship with the king, they seem to have been important rulers in their own right. Fuhao enjoying a reputation as a warrior queen.   But Fujing it seems was regarded as an authority on agriculture. Military power and in agriculture, the twin pillars of the state.   And agriculture was by no means the lesser of the two. On the strangely-shaped Dahe Ding, there are depictions of what seems to be a woman's face alongside the characters Da and He.   Hua is the generic term for grain. One interpretation is that square cauldrons held grains in rituals performed in honor of the earth while round ones held meat and were used in rites to honor the heavens.   Since the earth was personified as the mother of all things, rights in her honor were performed by high-ranking women and using square cauldrons. Over time, the symbolism of these cauldrons became part of the Chinese national psyche, even to the extent of becoming part of the vocabulary of everyday life.   Indeed, the character for Ding or cauldron forms an element in many Chinese words, especially those with connotations of nobility and solemnity.

11,Fu Hao's Jade Phoenix,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. It's been knocked about a bit. That's to be expected after 2300 years.   Yet, scorched and battered though it undoubtedly is, on the whole, the ravages of time have been rather kind to the sheet of bronze. Look behind the dents and marks, and you can still make out the gold and silver lives of what might be the earliest surviving architectural drawing.   The plan of a proposed mausoleum for King Cuo, ruler of the state of Zhongshan, during the warring States Period. In fact, his existence is only known from inscriptions on these bronzes, which record that he dispatched troops to the state of Yan, helped put down an uprising.   The expedition was evidently successful and commemorated with a cauldron made from the spoils of war taken on the campaign. Located in what is now Hu of a province, sandwiched between two very powerful states, the affairs of her neighbors were very much Zhongshan's business in those turbulent times.   The bronze edging shows that King Cuo's ambitions weren't restricted to this life. Laid to rest in this palatial tomb complex, he would be a mighty king in death, too.   It was an ambitious scheme. The precise size and shape of each building, as well as the entire site, specified on this 96 by 48 centimeter drawing.   The drawings and plans are one thing, reality another. It's only when you take a look at the proposed site from the air that you start to get a real sense of what the King had in mind.   From his palatial tumb, Cuo would be at the center of this miniature kingdom of the dead. Sadly, perhaps, it was not meant to be — Zhongshan was destined to be wiped from the face of the earth.   Only the tombs of the king and his queen were ever completed. Poignant monuments to a king sported ambitions.   Gone, but not quite forgotten. 2,300 years later, the bronze is bearing Cuo's name resurfaced, a reminder of both of a long-forgotten footnote in the history of the warring States Period and the technological sophistication of ancient China.   What we see here is bronze of the finest quality, the work of a master craftsman with the most advanced broadcasting techniques at his fingertips. Stunningly decorated, it has a peculiarly contemporary feel to it.   Designed as a modular piece, the consists of individual parts ready to be disassembled, boxed up, taken away, at a moment's notice. This tiger is exquisitely well-observed.   The weight of the beast apparently displaced by the power of the bite inflicted on the frail fragile deer. It's also the ideal shape for a stand designed to support two fold-away screens.   These bronze tent fixtures are another good example of warring States modular design, a demonstration perhaps of just how important portability was back then. In a sense, these items embody the spirit of those times.   Invention born of necessity, flexibility essential, to surviving a ceaseless conflict of the warring States period. The time when for rulers and ruled alike, life was a constant battle, peace and repose only to be found in death.",RV-3171-8,Jade,"jade pendant

12,Xiao Zun,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   At first glance, it looks like a dog squatting on its hind legs, but it's not.   It is in fact, a ""zun"", a type of wine vessel in the shape of an owl.   Half a metre tall, its head slightly raised.   Its face turned towards the sky; its wings folded.   There's something cocky, self-assured about this owl.   Decorated with motifs of other animals, its tail feathers reached the ground, acting as a third leg, thus giving the vessel even more support.   It's certainly popular with the youngsters.   Henan Museum, its home, has created many best-selling cultural products based on it.   Indeed, so iconic is this bird that some even joke that it proves that 3000 years ago the Chinese invented the first angry bird.   It was discovered in the tomb of Fu How, a famous Queen of the Shang Dynasty.   She was not only the wife of King Wu Ding, but also the first documented female to wield power in her own right.   During her lifetime, she played an active role in public life, performed important rites, led armies into battle, and helped her husband usher in a golden age for the Shang dynasty.   Since it witnessed the life and achievements of this remarkable woman, some even see this bronze Isle-shaped wine vessel as a symbol of Fu How.   In fact, owl motifs are seen in artifacts dating from the Shang Dynasty.   Symbolism based on birds was often used in this period, and the owl seems to have been an especially significant bird.   While some experts say that people in the Shang Dynasty saw it as a symbol of victory in war, others argue that it symbolized class status and power.   Others maintain that the people of the Shang regarded this bird as their mythical progenitor.   Indeed, it's a view that, according to his performance, is supported by the character of Shang, as it appears in the oracle bone script, reminiscent of the face of an owl.   Others, however, dispute the interpretation.   Nonetheless, what's certain is that the owl was the most important symbol in Shang Dynasty China, the most frequently occurring bird motif on bronze sacrificial vessels.   Of course, the Shang were not the only admirers of the owl, the ancient Greeks, too, revered the owl.   Athena the Greek goddess of wisdom was often depicted with an owl.   A nocturnal hunter, apparently capable of seeing clearly in the blackest of nights.   It's little wonder this bird became associated with wisdom and clear-sightedness.   The image of the owl also appears in Shang Dynasty stone statures.   One common theme runs throughout these depictions — dignity and stateliness — something not seen in depictions of the owl in the subsequent years of Chinese history.   At some point during the years after the Shang Dynasty, the owl appears to have fallen from grace, thereafter, it was seen as an ominous sinister bird.   For example, a poem in the Book of Songs talks of the hateful owl: ""The abductor of babies, the destroyer of homes."" In the years of the Zhou Dynasty, the culture of the Shang Dynasty was completely overturned.   By the time of the Han Dynasty, the owl was well and truly a bird of ill omen.   Jia Yi, a noted poet of the Western Han, characterised bad times as those of when the Phoenix hides and the owl hovers.   Likewise, popular sayings like ""Fear not the owl's hoot, but beware of its laughs."" which remains in use to the present day, are further reminders of the Owls' fall from grace in Chinese culture.   Whether seen as a noble bird, one of ill omen, or merely cute, one thing's for sure — the owl itself is much the same as it's always been.   It's culture that's changed, constantly evolving, changing people's minds.",7160-52,Bronze vessel,"This five-piece altar set uses the shapes of ancient Chinese bronzes.

13,Li Gui,"You have a new message from an ancient treasure.   3,000 years ago, King Wu of Zhou bestowed a gift on a loyal official named Li, the gift was a precious one: bronze.   Li had the bronze made into a bowl-shaped vessel called a ""Gui"".   Li held the position of ""Yousi"" or Minister.   In itself, Li's Gui gray isn't particularly impressive, yet historians consider it very important.   Considering the population of the time, 700,000 seems a very exaggerated figure; as for when the battle was fought, more than 40 different dates have been suggested.   In ancient times, people kept cereal in a Gui.   In the strict hierarchy of Western Zhou, vessels used in sacrifices and at banquets were imbued with specific significance.   So they became symbols of the state's system of rituals.   The number of vessels you were permitted to own was determined by your rank.   The king owned nine Ding and eight Gui; the feudal princes seven Ding and six Gui ; and officials five ding and four Gui.   In fact, Gui were quite common in Western Zhou.   What makes Li's Gui special is the 30-character inscription on its bottom describing Zhou's victory over Shang.   When King Wu defeated Shang, it was the early morning of Jiazi, and the Sui was at its zenith.   Sui is an ancient name for Jupiter.   So on a day called Jiazi, Jupiter was at its highest point in the sky.   Experts used carbon-14 dating to analyze ash samples from the Western Zhou period.   They established that the conquest of Shang occurred between 1050 and 1020 BC.   Astronomers then used the ancient historical text discourses of the states to determine when Jupiter reached its highest point during the day of Jiazi.   They arrived at the 20th of January in 1046 BC, a famous historical mystery was finally solved.   Li's Gui dates from the transition between the Shang and Zhou dynasties.   To most people, establishing the exact date of the transition of power from Shang to Zhou is not all that important.   Far more interesting is the fact that these 30 characters are communicating a message from an ancestor 3,000 years ago.",RV-360-431-b,Jade vessel,"One of two vessels made of glass cast in a mold (as can be seen from the seams on the handles).

14,He Zun,"You have a new message from an ancient treasure.   This imposing richly ornamented figure hides a secret that only the wise can interpret.   This national treasure tells of two young hearts beating in unison and of a state remaining true to its aspirations.   At sunset, three thousand years ago, two youths watched their shadows lengthening.   One of them would build a city that prospers to this day; the other would forge a bronze vessel that has survived a dozen dynasties.   Their fathers had fought together to establish a new dynasty — Zhou.   One of the young people was the new king — Cheng of Zhou; the other was He — his cousin.   The new king was ten years old when he ascended the throne, but he was fortunate because he had the support of his uncle — the Duke of Zhou, a man later praised by Confucius himself for his statesmanship.   Following the last wishes of the old king, King Cheng moved his capital the three hundred kilometers from Xi'an to Luoyang.   The young He shared the new Kings vision.   His father had served the old king well, and he wanted to do the same for his successor.   They obtained permission to forge a bronze Zun, on it, he had inscribed the feats of Qing Cheng's and his own ancestors, and of Qing Chun himself.   The 122 character inscription contains the phrase ""Zhai zi Zhong Guo"".   This provides the answer to an ancient question.   This is the first recorded use of ""Zhong Guo"", the modern Chinese word for ""China"".   ""Zhai zi"" means to live here, baners raised around a city form a ""Zhong"", or ""center"".   Combining River and soldier forms ""Guo"", the word for ""country"".   ""Zhong Guo"" referred to the center of the kingdom, the new capital Chengzhou, lay near today's law young.   Dedicated to He's ancestors, these words convey a message to Chinese people today.   Over the next 3,000 years as dynasties rose and fell, the word ""Zhong Guo"" evolved to mean a geographical political and cultural center.   By the late 19th century, the word was appearing in official documents as the country's name.   Those youthful shadows disappeared long ago.   But Luoyang is still prospering.   In 1963, He's gift to the king was unearthed from a hill in Shaanxi province.   It may have lost its original sheen, but the 122 characters inscribed on it can still be read.   They relate tales of the feats performed by He's forefathers.   3,000 years ago, the word ""Zhong Guo"" was buried deep in the earth.   When it again saw the light of day, its meaning had expanded to cover 9.6 million square kilometers of that same earth.",RV-1653-7,Ritual bronze,"An inscription in archaic character characters is made on the inside of the bottom of the jug. This shows that the jug was made for a certain Han Zha, grandson of King Fu Ren of Qi. The text is a command to his sons and grandsons to ""consider and use this yi eternally as a precious thing.""

Ritual bronze vessels were already made during the Shang-Yin dynasty (circa 1500-1100 BC). Pitchers of this type date from the end of the Western or Early Zhou period (circa 1027-771 BC).
From certain style features, such as the long legs and the large deep horizontal grooves, it can be concluded that the jug was built around 800 BC. Must have been made, probably in the heartland of Chinese civilization, at the middle reaches of the Huang He (Yellow River) where it joins the Wei River. This area is located in present-day Shaanxi province.

Inscriptions :㠱甫人余。余王󱮡𠭯孫𢆶乍寶也。子子孫孫永寶用。 The Lady of the State of Ji, descendant of King [?] of the State of Xu had this valuable yi made. May the children and grandchildren of future generations preserve and use it forever."
15,Jade Pendant Set,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   I was born 3,000 years ago, during the Western Zhou dynasty.   I've been here ever since a time capsule buried in the earth.   The years have taken their toll, a string that kept me together has long since rotted away.   But it's still all there, all 204 pieces of me.   In a sense, the 204 pieces of me are individual words, each one meaningful in itself.   Strung together, they're part of something more meaningful — a sentence.   Born around someone's neck, more meaningful still — part of a paragraph, part of a story, part of a new world of meaning.   A world in which dragons and geese sit side-by-side, or fish and silkworms dangle on the same threat.   Here, we see two dragons intertwined, but these are not quite the dragons we've come to know above.   These blend elements of the dragon with that of the Phoenix, one even as a human head.   Each piece of jade brought alive by a powerful imagination long ago, then strung together into a menagerie creatures of land, sea, sky, and the imagination, dancing on a chain.   In these days of its glory, the entire Jade chain would have dangled nearly down to the feet.   Other Jade items were found along sided in the tomb, from which it was unearthed, show that whoever was buried here was laid to rest covered in Jade from head to toe.   But it was about more than the ostentation of wealth, the trappings of status.   Beautiful and valuable though jade is, being adorned with it was also spiritual, an expression of love for the world, a way of imbuing the body with its power.   Because of that, the Zhou bequeathed the continuing legacy, one of the constant themes of Chinese culture — Jade ware.   Nevertheless, it was about wealth and status, too.   Hierarchy was strictly defined during the Western Zhou dynasty, and it was reflected in what people wore.   This Jade Pendant would have hung almost to the feet, inhibiting movement, suitable only for somebody who lives the somewhat almost leisurely life.   In those days, etiquette was very important, an invisible informal system of law and regulation.   That's one reason why Jade became so important — as a carrier of etiquette, something that defined a person's moral and social standing.   Billions of years ago, movements in the Earth's crust created Jade.   Our ancestors dug it up, holding in their bare hands as substance already rich in history.   Stone get statued over eons, brought down from the highest mountain peaks to the beds of the rivers, by processes that took millions of years.   Historically, the journey has been shortened, but no less significant.   Three thousand years of change in progress, of countless lives, of the rise and fall of dynasties.   Maybe that's why this pendant is so special.   It's a fusion of the wonders of human culture and creativity, and the eternal beauty of nature and the universe.",RV-1653-3,Ruyi,"Ruyi of jade, with emerald green clouds, mushroom-shaped. With red silk trimmings and long tassel. The ruyi is an object originating from India and, according to the Tzu-Yuan, was originally made in the shape of fingers to indicate things that could not be reached with the hand. The work was made in all kinds of materials such as bone, wood, bronze, jasper and iron. The scepter mainly came into use among Buddhist priests. In ancient Chinese poems it also seems to be spoken of as a crab staff. On the other hand, it seems to have been used as a sign of dignity.

16,Sanxingdui Bronze Figure,"When our eyes meet these portraits, it is destined to be an encounter that belongs to the entire planet. Their distinctive features mark them out from ordinary people. Without exception, there are protruding eyes and thin lips in a stony expression, and the earlobes are all perforated. In ancient times, ear pendants would have been a sign of special status. The 57 bronze heads of different sizes are like an enigma, which can be classified as domed and flat-topped and gold-faced as far as we know. The domed heads have hat bands, and individual heads come with rolls at the back of the head, like coiled hair buns. Flat-topped avatars, some braided hair at the back of the head, most of them with a plain face without a hat, one of the avatars on the hat has a back pattern decoration, with a disc hat belongs to the typical Sichuan-Shu characteristics. Only four gold-faced heads were unearthed, most of the gold colour has fallen off, only one is basically intact. Gold is made of gold whacked into gold foil, with raw lacquer mixed with lime as a binder attached to the surface of the mask. Gold has been a symbol of power since ancient times, and the dazzling gold colour highlights the more honourable status of the figure. This is one of the most unusual of the Sanxingdui heads, very different in style from the others, with soft facial features and a child's mouth at the top of his head. Now his headdress is windy, and we speak to them with conjecture and imagination. Many judge that she may have been a woman, and when the trappings of divinity are removed, it is as if she has returned to the side of human nature. Where do they really come from? And why are they so different from us? Ancient Shu civilisation has always been treated as a regional culture, rarely appearing in official history books, so when their glorious ruins suddenly appeared in front of the world people preferred to believe that the bronze head's grave expression was looking away from its homeland. During the Warring States period, with the unification of the six states by Qin, ancient Shu was annexed by Qin. Prior to this, the people of Shu had been immersed in a political life where divine power and royal power were united, with strong colours of divine witchcraft. Such a large bronze statue of a standing man is the highest in rank among all bronze figures. He might be the leader who held supreme secular power and could communicate with heaven and earth at the same time. In the late period of Sanxingdui civilisation the Middle Kingdom was in the Yin-Shang era. The Shang dynasty made a lot of bronze weapons, food and wine vessels, and sacrificed living human beings to the gods, which was an era full of bloodshed. However, no human sacrifices were ever found in the sacrificial pits of Sanxingdui, not to mention a single weapon. These cold-looking ancient Shu people possessed a light of humanity that transcended the times. This may be the reason for their power, and perhaps also the seed of their demise. Why did the ancient Shu civilisation possess such extraordinary imagination? Looking into their eyes, those heartbeats that transcend language may be the mystery hidden in our lives. We are human beings, and we stand here and on earth.", RV-2409-1,Funeral figure,"Statues of this type were placed in the grave to assist the deceased as a servant in the afterlife. Some statues were provided with tattoos and clothing, as people wore at that time. No traces of this can be found on this statue - made in the 'Warring States' period.

There were two types of funerary figures: statues of ancestors and staff for the deceased. The soul tablets emerged from the ancestor images. A soul tablet is a vertically placed shelf in which the soul of a deceased person resides.
Since ancient times, the Chinese have regarded the afterlife as a reflection of earthly reality. The dead are therefore symbolically given things that could be useful and enjoyable. In the past, these objects were made in miniature from earthenware: models of consumer goods and luxury items, buildings, servants and livestock.
Nowadays people still give gifts to the dead. They are made of paper and burned for the dead.

17,Sanxingdui Bronze Sacred Tree,"The excavation site of the Sanxingdui ruins exceeded everyone's expectations. Looking at the situation, it seems that everything here was smashed and burnt three thousand years ago, as if a nirvana had been accomplished. Hundreds of bronze fragments were unearthed from the second sacrificial pit. Can these fragments left on earth still collage a hint of that world? The Samsungdui artefact restoration team has spent eight years piecing together the largest and most complete piece from here three thousand years ago. As it is presented, new mysteries ensue. The intention of the artefact is completely beyond people's experience. The bronze vessel in front of us is 3.96 metres high and consists of two parts: the base and the main body. The top of the tree is broken, the base seems to be connected to three mountains, and the main trunk is three layers, climbing up at the top of the mountain. People can easily associate it with a big tree. The branches of the tree are divided into three layers, with three branches on each layer. There are two fruiting branches on each branch, one upward and one downward. The fruit rests are so large that there are nine birds in the whole tree, standing on the fruit of the upward branch. Looking more closely, we can see how remarkable it is. A dragon comes down along the side of the main trunk, ready to fly, and it is not difficult to imagine the magnificent sight of it flying in the air. The tree does not seem to have grown on earth, nor is it just the ancient Shu ancestors' understanding of nature, not just their observation of birds crossing the sky and perching in the trees. Several trees may symbolise the nine heavens and whether the top of the tree is already beyond them. The secrets held by the sacred trees may be more than that. More metaphors and symbols can be seen in the base of another bronze sacred tree that has so far only been restored out of its lower section. On each of its three sides, there is a kneeling bronze figure with a broken forearm, which, referring to other excavated bronze figures, is likely to be a representation of a sacrificial ceremony with both arms outstretched and holding ceremonial objects such as a jangzhong (璋琮). Other bronzes unearthed at Sanxingdui also confirm the extraordinary creativity of the ancient Shu ancestors, who were constantly trying to communicate with heaven and earth and to understand the possibility of the universe. These symbols, like the bronze sacred trees, may have come from a ritual. These may have transcended their everyday visible images to become symbols, to become possessed of mysterious powers that have travelled to another dimension and time. In the myths of all major civilisations around the world, the great trees are spirits between heaven and earth. History, civilisation and imagination all seem to be constructed in the same way. This connection is like a tree-like structure. The establishment of heaven and earth, the tree of life, has become an ancient symbol of mankind.",RV-2798-30,Yama,"Yama is the God of Death and Protector of the South. Buddhists seek protection from death in Yama.

Yama stands in a threatening position on his mount, the buffalo. They crush death, depicted as a corpse. The god has a buffalo head and flaming hair. In his right hand he holds a danda, a club with a skull. In doing so he punishes the enemies of Buddhist teachings. In his left hand he originally held a lasso, with which he dragged away the souls of sinners.
Yama is one of the Dharmapalas, the protectors of Buddhist teachings. With their fearsome appearance they fight evil demons and other enemies of Buddhism. They are especially venerated in the Himalayas.
A chakra, wheel, is depicted on his stomach. This is the symbol of Buddha's teachings. It indicates that this image was used in Buddhist worship.
Yama is originally a Hindu god. Like many other Hindu gods, he was adopted by the Buddhists, who continue to worship him in the same functions."
18,Golden Sun Bird,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   With its godlike dazzling golden beams, its discovery in Jinsha Sichuan, came like a bolt from the blue.   A sudden flash of lightning momentarily lighting up a long-lost world, one buried in the depths of time for three thousand years.   It's strange, mystical birds dancing and flying before our very eyes.   Less than 13 centimeters across and barely a fifth of a millimeter thick, this sliver of gold somehow embodies the light of life, the gleaming glory of the Sun itself.   The essence of the world's five ancient civilizations condensed into a piece of gold, small enough to fit in the palm of a hand.   But what does it mean?   Some believe the swirling fireball is the sun guy, and the four Birds is messengers — the four cardinal directions.   Others meanwhile believe that the four birds are carrying a fireball — the Sun — around the Sun, as described in early Chinese mythology.   Others still interpret the four birds as the passage of the Four Seasons with the twelve sunbeams being the months of the year.   Thus, what we have here is literally a microcosm, a depiction of the universe as seen by an ancient almost forgotten people — the Shu people.   Living in what is now Sichuan, the Shu people had to contend with the changing environment and a changeable climate.   For them, it was especially important to understand the Sun, to have a relationship with it.   And that most likely is why artifacts like these were created.   More than depictions of the world, the world they could see, hear, and feel, they symbolized a higher, deeper reality, one that governed their everyday existence.   What all these eyes and birds actually do is symbolize the holy all sustaining power of a God — the Sun.   And what better material to portray that symbol and by using a metal that gleams with a luster as strong as the Sun itself? — Gold.   This is where the Sun, an immortal bird gold ornament was discovered.   Archeologists believe that here, 3,000 years ago, along the banks of the river, people of his Shu culture performed sacrificial rites in honor of the Sun.   It's a belief supported by the evidence: nine square shaped holes, probably made for the pillars that supported the sacrificial altar, and pits containing what would have been valuable treasure — ivory, deer antlers, boar tusks, jade objects, and gold.   Treasure intended not for human beings, but freely given as gifts to Nature herself.   Of course, the beliefs that sustain these rites and ceremonies have long been forgotten.   So from our modern vantage point, it's impossible to decode true real meaning of this mysterious talisman with this sun and bird motifs.   All we can say for sure is that this delicate sliver of burnished gold with its Phoenix-like dancing birds is lasting testimony to a very important fact.   3,000 years ago, a now-forgotten people lived and struggled here, just like us — another people under the Sun.",RV-1650-4,Mahakala,"Mahakala is one of the Dharmapalas, the protectors of Buddhist teachings. With their fearsome appearance they fight evil demons and other enemies of Buddhism. They also combat the evil elements within every being.

Dharmapalas are mainly worshiped in the Himalayas. The god Mahakala stands here in a menacing pose on a headless human figure lying on a lotus-shaped pedestal. Its appearance is terrifying. In his wild hair he wears a skull diadem and snakes. He makes the gesture of warning, tarjanimudra, with his middle left hand. In his other hands he holds the attributes with which he fights the enemies: a sacrificial knife, a skull bowl, a trident, a prayer bead of skulls and a double-sided drum.
Mahakala has its origins in the Hindu god Shiva. In his guise as the Destroyer, he also carries a trident, a double-sided drum, snakes and a tiger skin as clothing."
19,Da Ke Ding,"""A special filming is going on in the Shanghai Museum. Three-dimensional holographic photography captures the complete information of cultural relics and builds ultra-high-definition three-dimensional models accordingly. Many details that cannot be seen or ignored from a normal perspective will be presented one by one. Dake Ding, the town treasure of Shanghai Museum, is 93.1 cm high with a calibre of 75.6 cm and weighs 201.5 kg. However, its value is not due to its huge size or simple shape, but to these mysterious writings hidden on the inner wall. They will lead us to read the Zhou Dynasty. The dignified and beautiful, the brilliantly written my grandfather, the impulsive and humble heart, the calm and serene mind, the pure and wise virtues. The book, cast in bronze, opens with words of praise. A nobleman named Ke has just received an official appointment from the King of Zhou. And this appointment is made possible by his grandfather's service in assisting the King of Zhou in that year. During the Western Zhou period, official positions were hereditary. The custom of praising the achievements of one's ancestors, often found on bronze vessels, was based on the requirement of etiquette, the so-called hiding of rites in vessels. Tripod in the Zhou Dynasty is the most important ceremonial instruments. The royal family and nobles often cast important events engraved in the bell, tripod and other bronze. This kind of text is called Zhong Ding Wen, also called Jin Wen. These bells and tripods were bronze books of history. There are 290 characters in Jinwen cast on the inner wall of the Dak Din. These inscriptions make the long ago age gradually clear. The king said, ""Give you the red ceremonial garment, the field of the wilderness, the field of ploughing, and the slaves of the land. The content of the Dak Ding is related to the Western Zhou official system, rituals, and land system; it is a book of bronze. In addition to its historical value, the Dak Ding has a high status in Chinese calligraphy. During the Western Zhou period, the bronze technology was exquisite, and the inscriptions could fully reflect the penmanship of calligraphy. The 290 characters of Da Ke Ding, with clear, elegant and neat handwriting, are representative of the Jinwen script of the late Western Zhou Dynasty. At the end of the inscription, Ke repeatedly prays that the goodwill of the Son of Heaven and the bounty of the ancestors will last forever, and be enjoyed by the children and grandchildren forever. But ""forever"" is only a good hope. Soon after the casting of the tripod, the Zhou Dynasty declined and the Spring and Autumn Period was overthrown, so where could the descendants of Kek go to settle down in the chaotic world? After the Qin Dynasty destroyed the six kingdoms, the Chinese script replaced the Golden Script with the Small Seal Script, and after the Han Dynasty, bronze wares gradually withdrew from the stage of history, and the pages of bronze books were completely closed, and since then, they have been lost in the dust of history. It was not until the discovery of the Great Ke Tripod in 1890 in a cellar in Fufeng County, Shaanxi Province, that a man called Ke was appointed by the King of Zhou for the merits of his ancestors, and given a great deal of land, clothes, and even subordinates, more than two thousand years ago. At the moment of glory in his life, he remembered his grandfather and hoped that his children and grandchildren would also enjoy this glory forever.""",RV-2622-5,Tripod “ding”,"This tripod with lid is called 'thing' in Chinese.

They have been found as grave goods in the graves of important people.

The tripod is decorated with various patterns: the background consists of so-called 'lei-wen' (spiral motifs), the belly shows graceful wave lines and a rope pattern in relief. The tripod is made with the so-called 'cire perdue' or 'lost wax' technique. The object is first modeled in wax. Clay is applied over the wax to form a mold. After the clay has hardened, the mold is heated so that the wax melts and drains. Finally, the hot bronze is poured into the mold.

A scene of brutality, a moment of violence, a fierce tiger tearing at the rear of an ox.   Huge horns no defense against the wild beast slobbering behind her. Her fate sealed, all she can do is to try her best to shelter the innocent calf under her belly, to stave off the inevitable for a few moments.   This unique relic is one of the few remaining traces of a long-lost ancient people called the Dian, a mysterious people who inhabited the vicinity of Lake Dianchi, in what is now Yunnan province some 2,000 years ago. Little is known about them because they left no written records.   For insights into the lives of this long-lost people, we must rely on the tangible legacy they did leave behind — superb bronze wear. For example, the Tiger Ox Alter, an amazing tableau in bronze of a life-and-death struggle.   On which more than 2,000 years ago, sacrifices were made in the hope of taming the wild, seemingly uncontrollable forces that filled life with danger and uncertainty. Perhaps that's why in a sense it's so poignant.   It encapsulates the hope that those forces could be controlled, the gods could keep the wolf, or in this case, ravening tiger from the door. Your children safe, in return for a small sacrifice of course.   The tiger and ox proved an enduring motif. Fast forward a few hundred years and though the ancient kingdom of the Dian is no more.   The two animals are still with us, by now appearing on a variety of different artifacts. The narratives different, too, gone the hapless, helpless cow of the altar.   Under the eyes of two frightened monkeys and a bird. While one ox cores the tiger, the other stops it making a getaway.   Shell containers were unique in the age of Dian Kingdom. They were used by kings and nobility of the Dian Kingdom, restoring seashells and other treasures.   Whoever cast it must have been an intrepid explorer, as well as a superb craftsman. It's a meticulously well-observe depiction of the law of the jungle and action, of nature red in tooth and claw.   It contains a message, too, that there's no need to dumbly submit to the law of nature. Even the tiger, the king of beasts, may be usurped.   Starting in the Han Dynasty, around 2200 years ago, depictions of scenes from real life began appearing on shell containers like these, giving us a fascinating microcosm of life in that vanished Kingdom. Especially into the lives of its ruling class. Its Kings and Nobles.   The picture that comes across is one of Pride and prosperity, of a life revolving around sacrifices to the gods. Sacrifice is rewarded by success in battle and hunting.   So far, about 100 shell containers have been unearthed at various sites in Yunnan. The motifs on earlier examples drawn from apparently mythological sources.   Later ones more inspired by everyday life. Exactly when is not known, but at some point during the eastern Han Dynasty beginning 2,000 years ago, the ancient Dian Kingdom disappeared, leaving nothing behind, save these bronzes.   Gone, forgotten, perhaps, or perhaps not. Next time you're in Yunnan, listen out: could it be that in a sense they're still with us?   Their voices echoing through the mountains and valleys.

21,Lotus and Crane Rectangular Hu,"""There is no one more like its name, a lotus flower, a crane composed of its name ---- Lotus Crane Square Pot. The crane spreads its wings and splashes the water waves to startle the petals of the lotus blossom, and also the blue waves of a thousand years of time. This is a masterpiece of the Bronze Age. The Lotus Crane Square Jug is a huge wine vessel, with two beasts with sideways heads and tongues at the base, a beast on each side of the jug, and dragon ears decorating both sides of the jug's neck. It has not held wine for thousands of years, but still holds the wildness of the wine of time, enchanting the moment. The Lotus and Crane Square Jug fits well with our pre-existing image of Shang and Zhou bronzes, hideous and terrifying to behold. At that time, bronzes were symbols of politics and power, mainly used for rituals, and needed to be visually stunning. Therefore, the snake and tiger, which have the power of attack in reality, together with the wings and huge eyes in fantasy, were combined to form the popular animal-face pattern and coiled chi dragons pattern at that time. The wide-open eyes of the beasts, the hornless dragons entwined with each other, and the monsters with two horns and two wings, which were out of the most innocent and intuitive fantasies of the creators at that time, were like templates adorning all kinds of bronzes at that time, which were dressed up in a horrible and scary way to show the majesty and status of the owners. However, the top of the square pot above these monsters and chi dragons shows us a different world. Amidst the blossoming lotus flowers stands a crane in flight. The Lotus and Crane Square Pot was excavated from the Great Tomb of the Duke of Zheng. More than two thousand years ago Zheng was a free spirit in the Book of Songs. The mountains had fusu, the sermons had lotus flowers, the girls and boys were laughing and joking among the large blooming lotus flowers, and everything was relaxed and beautiful. Perhaps this atmosphere pervaded the region at that time and became the style of Zheng. The craftsmen who made the Lotus Crane Square Pots put lotus flowers in full bloom on the bronzes, and the gravity was able to bloom into a kind of lightness. Since the Han Dynasty, bronze has been gradually replaced by iron, lacquer and porcelain, but the Chinese imagination of the lotus and the crane has never ceased, and the lotus flower, which is so untainted by silt, has entered the poets' poetic lines and become a symbol of character. The crane, which flies between heaven and earth, flew into the legends of the immortals and became a crane that could communicate with heaven and earth. On the Spring and Autumn period lotus and crane square pots as if still in its infancy, the crane has not yet occupied the main position, ordinary people at first glance thought that a small bird stood on it. A small bird brings a piece of the sky, turning the weight of the large pot into a flowing flight, distinguishing it from the solemn and solemn bronzes of the previous dynasty, and revealing the weather that drives out the old and brings in the new. The fusion of the old and the new in a single pot is also a sign that the Eastern Zhou, which was born out of the old and dignified Western Zhou and underwent a great change, is beginning a bloom that spreads its wings and looks up at the sky of China for the next two thousand years.""",WM-30045,Bronze vessel with lid,"Bronze vessel with lid.

22,Bronze Zun-pan of Marquis Yi of Zeng,"""The Zenghouyi Zun plate is both an iconic piece of the lost wax method and a totem for the bronze craftsman. Thousands of curled up monsters are coiled on the Zun disc, the vipers are small curled up snakes, and the chi dragons are dragons without two horns. After the disc was unearthed, there was great controversy over how it was made. There was much speculation as to what exactly the craftsmen of over two dry years ago had used to put them together. It was only after a craftsman successfully cast a one-to-one replica using the lost-wax method over a period of twenty years that the mystery of the Zun disc's manufacture was finally solved. This craftsman is had quietly involved in the excavation of ZengHouYi tomb staff JinZhou (at that time is completely by interest, lost wax method, no one do, I began to go along with this, I said I come to engage in the lost wax method, to see how it is. So many years, I can not remember now, really dozens of times, the beginning of this is not plaster, it can only engage in a rough geometry, carving, carved into a relief like a plaster model, stereotypes began to study the wax model) from plaster to wax model, this process although the use of silicone such as modern materials, but the principle of production and the ancients and there is no essential difference. (So I feel that this lost wax method, our ancestors that wisdom is too big, every time I do, I think about two dry years ago, I now use the tools are what electricity na, what iron ah, that are not the same, that time how they do, it is really very difficult. (I do every time, I do after our ancestors that is really called admiration to worship to the ground, is that way) Ancient no machine tools, can not be directly in the bronze carving, can only use the intermediary substance paraffin wax. Paraffin wax is soft and can be engraved with complex patterns. This is the beginning of the Lost Wax ProcessThe wax moulds are carved and covered with three layers of quartz sand, which lasts for two days to form a hard shell. The parts are then burnt in a furnace, which leads to the most crucial process of the Lost Wax Process. The wax water is lost, forming cavities that become the veins of the copper water. The craftsmen's ingenuity spreads slowly over the cavities with invisible veins under the force of gravity. When the copper solidifies and the thick coat is gradually peeled off, a part of the disc is declared complete. Even with modern tools, it takes a month to perfect a small part. It is hard to imagine what kind of state of mind and what kind of will the person who made the disc had to complete such an intricate piece of work for people to admire and marvel at 2,000 years later.""",RV-4522-1GI,Funeral canbinet,This cabinet is part of a set of twenty miniatures made of green glazed stoneware.

Those in ancient China who had to prove their identity, explain their arrival or justify their presence, for example contractors, envoys, couriers, soldiers and others, could use a fu. A fu is an object of which the two component parts are shaped and especially marked in such a way that they only fit together in one way and can form a unit. The materials used to make such fu mainly included bamboo and metals including iron and bronze. There was a relatively rapid and drastic change in the use of the fu after the Tang dynasty (618-906), because they were no longer made as two fitting parts, but as a solid whole. Although the concept of fu remained, the object itself came to be referred to as pai, ie 'tablet, placard'. The text on the placard indicated who the bearer was or what profession he practiced and that was sufficient. The bronze plaque shown here most likely dates from the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and, according to the inscription, served as a passport for senior officers who worked within the walled fortress of the imperial district in the capital Beijing. In translation, the text on this pai could read: 'He who is on duty should hang this placard on his belt. If he passes through [one of] the four gates outside the imperial city, this is not necessary. [high] military officers [pai]'. An important peculiarity of this placard and its counterpart (No. 5537-2A) is that they have a kind of border writing that, in accordance with the principle of the fu, consists of only parts of character marks.
With regard to the presence of the fish as decoration on this plaque, it is suspected that they are a reminiscence of the most common appearance of the fu, the fish shape, in the Tang period."
25,Hu-fu (Two-Piece Tiger Tallies),"""This budding bronze tiger lies quietly on its back, and at first glance, there is no sense of distance separated by a thousand years. But the wrong gold inscription and a regular centre seam on it foretells its extraordinary identity - a military talisman. The tiger talisman means military power, and seeing the talisman means seeing the ruler. More than 2,000 years ago, the ruler of Xinling took the risk of risking his life to get it. The Qin army had already surrounded the capital city of Zhao, and with the loss of lips and teeth, the kingdom of Zhao would be destroyed, and the kingdom of Wei would also be in danger. And the king of Wei had already refused his request to reinforce Zhao several times for fear of Thailand's retaliation. The difficulty for Lord Xinling was whether he should find a way to steal the tiger symbol to reinforce Zhao, which he eventually did. When the tiger symbol was stolen, Zhao was saved and Wei had temporary safety. The tiger symbol became the turning point of the country's life and death. There are only three tiger talismans in existence, the Yangling Tiger Talisman, the Du Tiger Talisman and the New Place Tiger Talisman. The Du Tiger Amulet, now in the Shaanxi History Museum, has the longest inscription of all the excavated tiger amulets. The forty misprinted seal script inscriptions are to the effect that the right talisman was in the hands of the king and the left talisman was in the hands of the generals of the place where the army was stationed. When mobilising the army, the king would send someone to the garrison with the right talisman. Only when it matches with the left talisman in the general's hand can the general send out his troops. During the Warring States period, wars were frequent and military emergencies were so great that the slightest mistake could affect the city. Since there were no modern means of communication, the monarchs relied on tiger symbols to convey military orders. In order to maintain secrecy, tiger symbols usually involve a small and hidden shape, to achieve the effective interface between the ""account"" and the ""password"". Tiger symbols are made up of two halves, one for the monarch and one for the general. The backs of the left and right talismans have their own mortise and tenon, one by one, corresponding to each other, and when the talisman arrives, the monarch arrives, and only when the tiger talismans of the same group are together can the army be dispatched, which is the origin of the term ""tiger talisman"". Ancient court to convey the order of the credentials in addition to the charm and section. Now hidden in the Anhui Provincial Museum of E Junqi copper section is China's earliest traffic tax-free vouchers found, equivalent to the current transport pass. The inscriptions on the bronze section record that it was issued by King Huai of Chu to his son, E Junqi, in 323 B.C. The section is divided into boat section and vehicle section. Copper section is divided into two kinds of boat section and car section, when used by both sides of the half, the joint section to verify that there is no error before the effect. Later with the development of the means of investigation, although gradually become the background of the history of the runic festival, but also not completely disappeared. In the subsequent two thousand years the logic of ""conformity"" verification has been rooted in the corner of human activities, guarding the order of modern society.""",RV-3507-1,Meta passport,"In ancient China those who had to prove their identity, explain their arrival, or justify their presence, for example contracting parties, ambassadors, couriers, and soldiers, had to use a fu, an object with two parts made and marked such that they could only be fitted together in one way to form a whole. The materials used to make such fu were mainly bamboo and various metals including iron and bronze. The use of the fu underwent a rapid and radical change after the Tang dynasty (AD 618-906) because they no longer consisted of two parts which had to be fitted together but were made as one piece. The concept fu persisted, but the object itself was called pai, tablet, insignia. The text on the pai indicated who the bearer was or his occupation, and this was considered sufficient. The bronze tablet shown here dates in all probability from the Ming dynasty and according to the inscription functioned as a kind of passport for kitchen personnel employed within the walled imperial precinct of the capital, Peking. In translation the text on this pai might be taken to read: 'He who is on duty must in that case hang this tablet on his belt. If he leaves the imperial city by [one of I the four gates, this is not necessary. [Pai for] cooks.' An important peculiarity of this tablet is that, as one of the few which has survived from the Ming period, it has a kind of inscription along the edge which, consistent with the principle of the -fu, carries only part of each character. Thus, there must have been another, matching tablet with the other part of the characters along its edge. Nevertheless, it is not likely that this pai was actually used as a fu, because one of the two fish on it - the one on the right (in high relief - is very worn, whereas the one on the left (inlow-relief) shows no signs of wear. This may perhaps be taken to mean that the two pendants were seldom or never fitted together. With respect to the presence of the two fish as decoration on this tablet, it is thought that they may be a reminiscence of the most frequently used shape of the fu in the Tang period, which was that of a fish."
26,Gold Crown with Eagle Finial,"""This gold crown once accompanied its owner to steer the steppe The eagle-topped gold crown decoration shows the highest level of precious metal craftsmanship of the northern Chinese nation during the Warring States period. It represents the glory of the steppe. The highest part of the gold crown is an eagle, the eagle's head, neck and tail are connected by gold wire. When the master galloped his horse, the eagle also vibrated with it, as if spreading its wings to fly. Petal-shaped gold crown engraved with four wolves biting four sheep pattern, the pipe belt is engraved with a tiger and prey tense confrontation, hunting as if a touch. In those days, there was no writing on the steppe, and history was written by their opponents. In the records of the Central Plains civilisation, the Huns were known as the ""long-snout tribe"", with ""long-snout"" meaning long-mouthed dog. They were greedy and brutal, and often travelled south to plunder. However, from the perspective of the king of the steppe, the world was probably not quite the same as the records of the Middle Kingdom. The nomadic steppe had a completely different sense of survival than the agrarian Middle Kingdom. On the ornaments of the steppe people, animals are the eternal theme, they are creeping for food, biting each other, waiting for an opportunity to move. And the eagle top gold crown decoration is the king of the grassland majesty, looking down on the world all the weak and strong. Is it fortunate or unfortunate to have a powerful and brutal opponent. In the Warring States period, King Wuling of Zhao finally made up his mind to give up his wide robe and big sleeves, and learnt to ride and shoot in Hu's clothes, and a duel between the imitator and the imitated thus began. The farming civilisation, which had always been on the defensive, finally established a unified empire in the Qin and Han Dynasties, and thus put up the ultimate defence - the Great Wall - with the help of the whole country. Not only was it a fortress to guard the borders, but when the Western Han Dynasty became strong, it became an outpost for counterattacks against the Xiongnu. But could the Great Wall really stop people from interacting with each other? On both sides of the Great Wall, there was war and peace. It wasn't until the Eastern Han Dynasty that the southern Xiongnu entered the region and the long-time rivals were finally united as one family. Today, when we look at the eagle's golden crown, can we remember the shadows that came and went like the wind? It is from the Warring States period onwards, in the confrontation and integration with one after another internal and external rivals, after undergoing metamorphosis after metamorphosis, Chinese civilisation's strong inclusiveness has gradually been awakened. Because of our rivals, we examine ourselves; because of our rivals, we understand ourselves; because of our rivals, we become a stronger version of ourselves.

""The collection of the great is also the sound of gold and the vibration of jade."" - Mencius ""Rites to restrain people, music to send out harmony"" - ""The Duke of Taishang's Self-Preface ""Poetry, Rites, and Music"" - The Analects of Confucius ""The eight tones of music are in harmony, and there is no competition between them.",RV-1119-30,Bell,"The sound of a prayer bell, ghanta, has a sacred effect. It drives away evil elements and purifies the environment of unclean influences. Religious symbols on the bell reinforce that power.

The handle of this bell depicts the head of a god, crowned by a vajra. A vajra is a scepter in the shape of a stylized lightning bolt. With this weapon demons and other spirits of darkness can be destroyed. The handle was probably added later.
There are three edges with symbols on the bell. An eight-petalled lotus is depicted on the top edge below the handle, a symbol of purity and spirituality. Each lotus leaf carries a mystical syllable. It refers to spiritual awakening, to purity. Vajras are depicted on the lower edge.
A ghanta is used in combination with a vajra for important rituals. The vajra symbolizes the masculine principle and the power of compassion. The bell represents the feminine principle and wisdom. These two opposite values, dynamic and passive, together form the ultimate truth and lead to Enlightenment. With a vajra in his right hand and a bell in his left hand, a priest embodies that ultimate truth."
29,Wood Carved Double Headed Tomb Guardian,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. The tomb Guardian is placed in a tomb to protect its occupant from forces unseen.   Eyes stretched wide, tongue protruding, it radiates defiance. But instead of cold hard bronze, it's made of warm softwood.   The body is decorated in delicate lines of scarlet paint that weave an abstract pattern. Four sets of antlers sprout from the crown, symbolizing the sprouting of new life.   Everything about it seems to betray its origins in the warm humid south in the ancient state of Chu. Chu was the home of mysteries and magic.   The state of Chu grew from a small semi-barbarian state on the middle reaches of the Yangtze to a great Kingdom that encompassed most of Southern China. It always held the image of a wild passionate and artistic people in contrast to the more staid and disciplined northerners.   nature and animals feature prominently in their art. A man drives a carriage by a willow tree.   Three people are running in front of him. With no perspective, it seems they could be suspended in the sky.   A pair of wild geese fly over them. Three others look up, seeking signs from the heavens.   The yellow dog chases after wild pigs. Spring is coming, friends whisper together under a tree.   Take care — someone could be listening. These tomb goods leave us with a strong feeling of the spirit of the two people.   It existed is both Chinese and yet still on a plane of its own. This lacquer coffin was made in the early Western Han Dynasty, just after 200 BC.   Over 300 sprites are seated among the clouds. This one pushes away from the cloud and sits in midair, smiling beatifically.   This one draws an arrow to his bow, aiming into the far distance. This one steals a thermal and lifts a Nimbus with its hand.   And this one tumbles like an acrobat, across the field of heaven. A lonely spirit sings to itself, while far away, another plays the zither.   These spirit guards from the spirit of Chu playful, skilled, and artistic. They reflect the environment of that ancient society.   Figures, human, animal, and somewhere in between fill the scene. With a single breath, the tomb Guardian has held by its post in the airless vault.   Neither would nor horn decayed. It maintains its vigil for us today, from 2,000 years to eternity.",RV-1997 -1,Funeral stature of a lion,"Mythological lion with probably dangerous protrusions on his back.
From the fifth and sixth centuries it became common to place images of mythological animals in and around imperial tombs and tombs of high-ranking figures. Usually the enormous statues outside the tombs are made of stone. The images have both a monitoring and guiding function. They must protect the deceased from evil spirits in the afterlife. Due to their impressive stature, they also symbolize the status and power of the deceased during his life.

The lion as one of the most powerful animals on earth was often used for this. Supernatural properties were added by, for example, giving land animals wings and/or surrounding them with artifacts from the spiritual world.

Mingqi is the Chinese word for grave goods. From the Han dynasty onwards it became customary to give ceramic objects to the deceased that were useful for the afterlife. According to the belief of that time, man consists of a body xing and a spirit that can consist of two or, according to later traditions, even seven or more spirits. When death occurs, the spirit splits into the pot that remains with the body and into the hun, the spirit that leaves the body and undertakes the often dangerous journey to the Western World or paradise. Food, utensils, maps, servants and other companions are provided to help both the chamber pot and theirs survive in the afterlife. In earlier times, people and animals, sometimes alive, and all kinds of luxury goods were buried for this purpose at important funerals of (emperors and generals, for example). When this use stopped, they were replaced by life-size replicas of pottery (see for example the terracotta army of the first Emperor Qin ( ) and then by smaller images. Nowadays the necessary attributes are made of paper and burned along with the body."
30,Silk Painting Depicting A Man Riding A Dragon,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   What becomes of us after death?   The Chu people who lived over 2,000 years ago believed that we enter an immortal realm.   Our traveler in time has a solemn look.   Dressed in his finery was sword at a gentleman's cap.   He rides his dragon mount into eternity.   The dragons raised head and tail, given a boat-like form.   This is indeed a voyage into the unknown.   The silk painting was made in the Warring States period, and is the earliest such found to date.   It was on Earth from the Zidanku tomb at Changsha, Hunan Province.   It rested on the boarding between the outer and the inner coffins.   It served as a pennant to lead the soul as its earthly farewell.   The canopy rises high in the air to show that the tombs occupant is wandering the skies.   A carp is leading the way from below.   The dragon is a mythical creature that can pass from this world to the next.   Oh, Soul, come back! The quarters of the world are full of harm.   Return to your old abode, your quiet and restful home.   The Chu people believe that after passing away, the earthly souls sank into the depths while the immortal spirit flew to the heavens.   The funeral's silk paintings placed between inner and outer coffins were intended to guide and protect the wandering spirit.   So it could return to earth immortal.   The T-shaped silk painting was created nearly 200 years later in the Western Han Dynasty.   It, too, was intended as a guide for the spirit of the departed.   It represents the cosmology of the people of Chu towards the end of the first millennium BC.   In the painting, life and death are joined in a dynamic cycle, like Yin and Yang.   The afterlife is governed by the same rules of time and space as the world we know.   The bottom of the silk painting depicts the underworld.   In the long darkness of night, a Titan stands on a dragon-headed fish, deters the demons and supports the earth above.   In the middle, the soul and spirit of the occupant are carried by two dragons and travel through the human world.   At the top, the gate to the heaven is wide open.   Sun and Moon shined together.   This is where the voyaging spirit will become immortal.   The inner and outer coffins are also painted with the views of the netherworld.   Although the form of life disappears for a while after death, with the blessing of sacred ritual objects, the balance of Yin and Yan can be restored.   The soul takes shape again and the life eternal continues in another dimension.   The Chu used fantastical and mysterious cultural symbols to illustrate the glorious path, leading the dead to another form of life.   Life and death are like day and night.   Life and death cannot be reversed by the human hand.   But like the changing seasons and repeating days, there are currents hidden in nature.   The Chu belief in the secrets of life was expressed in their colorful paintings.   They did not fear death, because they believed that death was not just the end of mortal being, but also the entry into the world of the immortal.   Treat the dead as a living, this is a view of life and death that has lived in China for thousands of years.   People believed that living as a man and becoming an immortal after death is the way of the universe.   And to get between life and death, earth and heaven, one should ride on a dragon.",RV-5920-3,China plate,"The painting on this plate shows the celebration of the Chinese New Year. Children walk in a parade with a paper dragon and paper fish, other children set off fireworks.

The Chinese calendar is not completely parallel to the Western calendar. As a result, the date of Chinese New Year varies - usually somewhere between late January and early February. The celebration of New Year, which is called Spring Festival, lasts a number of days and is all about reconciliation. The Chinese visit their family and friends and hand out gifts. They decorate their homes with red cutouts and symbols of longevity, happiness and wealth. They light fireworks to drive away evil spirits. According to an old legend, the monster Nian came to terrorize the people just before New Year. The color red and loud bangs could scare him away.
The New Year period turns into the Lantern Festival after fifteen days. This festival is accompanied by many parades with dancing and lanterns. This sign may show the transition from Spring Festival to Lantern Festival."
31,The Terracotta Warriors,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   The tranquil and ordered scenery belies the extraordinary magnificence of what lies beneath.   Below the modest monument, Lishan tomb, a tomb in which the history of an empire is frozen for all eternity.   It was in 1974 that the first stirrings of an incredible discovery were made — an underground army part of the vast tomb complex for China's first emperor was gradually disinterred.   The dust on the mirror was accidentally stirred up — Terracotta Warriors and horses of the first emperor of Qin at the foot of Lishan mountain were exposed.   The mirror of time allows us to reflect on what this means then and now.   Qin Shihuang's seven thousand-strong immortal army is arrayed in three great pits near his tomb at Lintong in Xi'an, the site of the Qin capital.   160 of these Terracotta Warriors in kneeling position were excavated at the east end of pit number 2. They form the vanguard.   They are archers, clad in their armor and hair tied up, ready for battle, holding real weaponry in their hands as they entered the underworld.   This archer is among the most junior ranked in the battle array.   He is also the epitome of these Qin warriors.   His head and back are straight, as his legs crossed over each other to form a steady triangle, a posture that provides both a steady platform from which to fight and offers a small target to the enemy.   This would have been textbook training drilled into his living comrades.   Our archer's chest and stomach are protected by large sections of plate.   The shoulders and waist have smaller pieces, allowing him to move and wield his bow.   The raised right foot supports the weight of the entire body.   The detailing of his footwear is precise: a thick robust heel and toe for marching, even the tread on the sole has been carefully reproduced to allow him to fight effectively in the netherworld.   The posture, the armor, and the clothing are exact reproductions of actual warriors; their faces, beards, and hair, all differentiated.   Only their weapons of bronze and wood have struggled with the test of time.   When they were first discovered and excavated, there was still color in the Warriors apparel and faces.   Faces that appeared to be so real, they might have been alive.   These are the faces of the men who united the Warring States into one great empire at the behest of their King.   The Stars travel across the sky.   Mountains and rivers stretch over the land.   Generations come and go.  But these man-made effigies hold the kaleidoscope of time, stopped in their hands.   Their power still rules the land; their Emperor still commands.   Above ground, the dynasty of Qin Shihuang is long gone, superseded by many others, imitators all.   Under the surface, in China's heart, these warriors still await command.   They are gone, yet they're here; and in truth, buried for all those centuries they never left.",RV-1997-3,Female funeral figure,"This grave statue was once given as an attendant to a deceased person. From the appearance of the female figure it can be deduced that the statue was made in the Tang period (618-906). Tomb statues are an important source of information about life in ancient China.

The Chinese view the afterlife as a reflection of earthly reality. That is why the dead are symbolically given things that can be useful to them on the other side. In the past, these were real objects; valuables made of gold and jade were even buried in the graves of the wealthy. Gradually they started to provide pottery miniatures. In old graves you can find models of consumer goods and luxury items, of buildings, servants and livestock. The valuables from the oldest graves were largely stolen over time, but grave goods made of earthenware are often better preserved. Nowadays people still give the same things to the dead. These are no longer made of sustainable materials, but are made of paper and burned for the dead."
32,Rectangular Measuring Vessel of Shang Yang,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   This mundane-looking rectangular bronze pan started a revolution.   It's a measuring vessel of Shang, the unit of a little over a fifth of a liter used for liquids or grain.   The conforming of differing standards into a single unified system was crucial to China's economic development and political psychology.   The ancient form of the character ""Sheng"" could be interpreted as a grain of rice sitting on a spoon.   Made of solid bronze, the rectangular vessel features abrupt vertical sides and a short handle.   On its outer surface, there's a 32-character inscription.   Like a birth certificate, it lists its time of creation, dimensions, and designer's name.   In this case, the designer's name is Da Liang Zao Yang, also known to history as Shangyang.   Da Liang Zao was his title as the reforming chief minister of the state of Qin.   In the fierce competition of the warring states here, each state sought to introduce a social, political, and military system that would gain it an edge over its rivals.   Shangyang believed nothing less than social revolution was required.   To enlist the support of the entire population, the first priority was to win their trust.   Legend has it that he erected a three-meter high wooden caber outside the capital south gate, and offered a reward to whoever could move it to the north gate.   No one dared try, so he increased the reward — one, two, three, four, five times.   Finally, someone was tempted and dared to move the caber.   Shangyang immediately fulfilled his promise.   Shangyang having demonstrated his trustworthiness.   The process of standardizing weights and measures could begin.   The ""Du"" was used to measure length; the ""Liang"" was used to measure capacity; the ""Heng"" was used to measure weight.   In earlier times, weights and measures varied from state to state, and even within an individual state, they could be wildly different.   Shangyang clearly defined the ""Sheng"" by producing a standard measure for it.   A simple measure that revolutionized trade and brought benefits to government and people alike.   Notably, because taxes and ties were to be paid ingrained.   Along with other reforms to encourage agriculture and military service, the state of Qin went from strength to strength.   This is the Imperial edict that was engraved onto the base of Shangyang's measuring vessel after Qin Shihuang unified China.   A total of 40 characters.   ""In 221 BC, the king of Qin overcame the last of his rivals to make himself ruler of all China, the first emperor."" A key aspect of the unification was the enforcement of universal standards in weight and measures, as well as in the writing of characters.   This has been an essential part of the glue of empire ever since.   Qin Shihuang's inscription sits two centimeters in distance and 123 years in time from those of Shang yang But in so doing, the ruler of the civilized world both implicitly and explicitly recognizes his debt to the bygone chief minister.   In a state based on a military agricultural system, a peasant household could provide men to serve or grain for taxes; and a unified measure meant a unified system for a unified state.   One measure, one people, one Emperor.", ,Jade vessel 2,"One of two vessels made of glass cast in a mold (as can be seen from the seams on the handles). The shape refers to ritual bronze vessels, the color to jade."
33,Qin Bronze Chariots and Horses,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. Not even the mightiest among us can escape death.   Though China's first emperor Qinshihuang certainly had elaborate plans to do so. In the winter of 1980, just west of the great tomb mound as Xi'an that houses the emperor's final resting place, two bronze models of a horse and chariot team were unearthed.   The first, chariot number one, is a high chariot, faithful in every detail to a life-size example including carriage, four horses, carriage ornaments, and a standing driver. The main parts of the model are made of bronze, while the ornaments are made from gold and silver.   In many places, it's finely painted. These are the most complete and detailed representations of how the elite aristocracy lived and travelled ever found by archaeologists.   The extravagant use of metals is characteristic of a ruler who felt that nothing was beyond his command. Chariot number one is 152 centimeters tall and 225 centimeters long, a half-size scale model of a real chariot.   The reduction in size distinguishes the chariot from other funerary objects. But as a model, it doesn't lose any detail.   It weighs more than a ton and is made of more than three thousand separate parts. The larger parts were made by hollow casting, while the wide or thin pieces are forged metals.   The many complex components were split into simple parts, which were assembled by hinges, buckles, rivets, and rings. The independent parts are precisely matched to each other, indicating the high quality of craftsmanship available to the Qin.   When Yingzheng, king of the state of Qin, established himself as ruler of all China in 221 BC, he gave himself a new title — Qinshihuang. The title which went further than simply first emperor, since it implied a unique authority to parlay with heaven.   Qinshihuang said about unifying his domain by reorganizing his government into commanderies, directly responsible to his central government, standardizing the written language and the system of weights and measures including even the width of carriage tracts. Qinshihuang made five tours of inspection around his empire.   He died in 210 BC during the fifth tour, aged 49. His body had to be brought back to the capital secretly, in a closed carriage with incense burnt to hide the smell of decay.   But his magnificent bronze chariots were there to await him, ready to travel west to the land of the Setting Sun and… life eternal.",RV-2542-1,Spearhead,"This spearhead was found in the Yellow River basin, which has been continuously inhabited since the fifth millennium BC. Bronze was discovered in this region about 3,500 years ago. The ax probably dates from the Zhou period (11 century - 221 BC).

The spearhead was given as a grave gift to a deceased person. The Chinese believed that people had the same needs in the afterlife as they did during their earthly existence. That is why the dead were given all kinds of practical things in their graves to be able to provide for themselves.

34,Liye Qin Slips,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   The year is 2018, and another of China's national treasures is about to spill its secrets.   Liye Qin Slips are held in their own Liye Qin Slips Museum in Hunan Province.   The wooden slips look inconspicuous, but hidden in the blurred characters is a huge amount of information.   It describes the life of a county under the Qin Dynasty in the late 3rd century BC.   In June, 2002, the discovery of over 37,400 slips in an ancient well in Liye, Hunan province, excited the world.   This is the record of a family that lived 2200 years ago.   The householder was Zheng Bubao, and given the title of Bugeng, which exempted him from corvée service.   He had a wife called You, and their son was called Zaosi.   It's an example of early imperial bureaucracy.   Wu Sao from Hanshenli in Handan, he has yellow skin, elliptical face, and is about 170 centimeters tall.   In 23 characters, it introduces us to Wu Sao from Hanshenli in Handan.   With the slip, Wu Sao could avoid his identity being stolen, officials could also use it as census data.   Although Wu's body has long turned to dust, this wooden slip has preserved his appearance for millennia.   After Qin Shihuang united his empire, he imposed the system of prefectures and counties.   There were more than 40 prefectures in total.   Dongting prefectures, Qianling County, was in all respects unremarkable amongst them.   The officials here were typical bureaucrats of their time.   The Liye Qin Slips are the day-to-day record of the government work.   Most of the slips relate to life from the Qin Dynasty, after Qin Shihuang united the warring states.   They cover events and affairs on a daily and monthly basis, from 221 BC to 209 BC.   Each slip is the record of an event.   It's a model of how the Qin administrative system worked.   The over 37 thousand pieces of slips are an encyclopedia of County life in the Qin Dynasty.   They cover subjects including postal communication, the administrative organization system, trade, arithmetic, daily events, and festivals.   It's a panorama of the operation of a Qin County under the system of prefectures and counties.   In 219 BC, the death rate of corvée service personnel in the county reached an alarming one in seven.   In 215 BC, the county's warehouse manager sold the last 15 liters of wine to a man called Cheung.   In the same year, there were 55,534 households in Qianling.   And there are even three pieces of one of the oldest multiplication tables discovered to date.   There are less than 1000 words in official dynastic records about the administrative system and social life under the Qin.   However, the 200,000 characters of the Liye Qin Slips vastly expand on this vacuum.   The lives of the officials and subjects of the early Empire live on in these 37,000 slips.   They are truly a shining treasure house of history.",RV-5111-1,Bamboo book,"Ten wooden slats with text, made in original size, from a grave of the Han period.

The oldest forms of Chinese writing are found on so-called ""oracle bones"".
This term refers to animal bones, such as shoulder blades or turtle shells, on which short texts have been scratched. They often date from the oldest historical period of China: the Shang dynasty, ca. 1500 - ca 11oo BC.
The bones or bowls with text were probably used in certain dowsing practices.
They were heated until cracks and fractures appeared. The cracks most likely formed the basis for the soothsayer's predictions.
Around 1900, scholars in China began to show interest in these oracle bones. At that time, they were mainly found near the town of Anyang, one of the capitals of the Shang period.
They were often traded by locals as ""dragon bones"",
to be ground up for intended medicinal purposes.
The study of the signs and pictographs on bones that had not been ground
revealed that some of those signs were clear precursors of today's Chinese script. This made them ""readable"" and historical data could be deduced from the written information. These data confirmed all kinds of information that until then had only been known from legends.
Until the invention of paper, almost 2000 years ago, people mainly used bamboo slats and silk to record texts after the oracle bones."

Zhao Tuo, it was on Qin Shi Huang's orders that he came to conquer the rivers and mountains south of the Five Ridges, and it was also he who guarded the peace of the Han Dynasty. It is recorded in the Historical Records that this king, who came from the Central Plains and possibly had the longest standby time in Chinese history, was, by all appearances, a Vietcong. Jade, originally a beautiful stone, was given a rich life and meaning by the Chinese, which could symbolise character, show off wealth and become a companion in life and death. By the Han Dynasty, jade appeared in all kinds of places before and after people's life and death, from ceremonial to decorative to instrumental, recorded the dimension and temperament of a dynasty's imagination. The South Vietnamese state, though located on the edge of the unified national map, pursued jade as intensely as the central plains. The image of the dragon is found on almost every jade object used for decoration during the Han dynasty: it is the dragon jade pendant, it is the dragon jade jade jewellery, it is the dragon and phoenix patterned heavy ring jade pendant. Two thousand years ago, it was superimposed on the face of the king of South Vietnam, also like a pupil, looking into the unseen places of human beings. The living are matched with jade to compare their virtues; the dead gather jade to comfort their spirits. In the Han Dynasty, jade clothes were a luxury item at the funerals of kings. May the body be clothed in jade, and the king be comforted in his nine springs. Jade, the beauty of stone. Jade is a little more than the word king.

36,The General's Tomb,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   Close by the great mausoleum of Emperor Wu of Han is the tomb of the Aurora Kyung warrior who served him — the legendary cavalry general, Huo Qubing.   Huo's tomb is built in the shape of the Qilian mountains to commemorate his many victories on China's Northwest Frontier.   Huo's tomb is surrounded by an extraordinary collection of carved stone statuary.   The figure of a man, a face wracked with pain and anguish.   When survival became too hard, there came war.   The fertile land of the central plains attracted ferocious predators.   This represents a goat being devoured by a beast, just as the Xiongnu horsemen would sweep down from Mongolia in the Northwest to pillage China's northern provinces.   They were an enemy much to be feared.   This stone steed rears up in defiance, just like the Han Dynasty was about to, in 140 BC, when the 16-year-old Emperor rule came to the throne and Huo Qubing was born.   The Han Dynasty had been founded some 62 years previously, and for all those decades, had lived with a Xiongnu threat.   A heavy-set stone man grapples with a wild bear.   This shows the sort of spirit that the teenage general took into battle with him.   At the age of 19, Huo Qubing led a lightning campaign in which he defeated five Xiongnu tribes in six days.   Time and again, he led his cavalry armies in overrunning Xiongnu forces and capturing their leaders.   On one occasion, he approached the enemy camp alone and persuaded them to surrender.   A mighty war horse tramples on a supine Xiongnu warrior, lying on his back with arrows in his right hand and a bow in the left hand.   In 119 BC, the 21-year-old Huo Qubing encircled and killed 70,000 Xiongnu warriors.   He conducted a series of rituals in the mountains of East Mongolia to symbolize this historic Han victory.   Before continuing his pursuit of the enemy as far north as Lake Baikal, he had effectively annihilated the Xiongnu clan.   After the battle, it was said the Xiongnu fled far away, and there was no Xiongnu in the southern desert.   The Han dynasty was freed from their historic past.   His contemporary, the grand historian Sima Qian said of him: ""He strengthened the border; resumed lost territory and whole Xi corridor; captured the Chilean mountains; connected with western areas and defeated the northern nomads."" It was to be a dazzling but a brief appearance on the stage of history.   Huo died in 117 BC, aged 23. The stone statues are silent in the wilderness.

The Chu used fantastical and mysterious cultural symbols to illustrate the glorious path, leading the dead to another form of life.   Life and death are like day and night.   Life and death cannot be reversed by the human hand.   But like the changing seasons and repeating days, there are currents hidden in nature.   The Chu belief in the secrets of life was expressed in their colorful paintings.   They did not fear death, because they believed that death was not just the end of mortal being, but also the entry into the world of the immortal.   Treat the dead as a living, this is a view of life and death that has lived in China for thousands of years.   People believed that living as a man and becoming an immortal after death is the way of the universe.

38,Jade Doorknocker with Four Symbols of the Sky,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   Knockers were common in ancient China, but this piece of Jade Doorknocker preserved in the Maoling Museum is the only one of its kind.   Amidst the clouds emerges the face of a mighty beast.   Although the knocking ring is lost, it still maintains an air of grandeur.   On its back is a bulging cuboid mortise for attaching through the door.   On the front, a pair of bulging eyes radiates intensity and vigor.   Images of animals can be seen among clouds on upper surfaces.   The Honourable dragon of honour.   Powerful tiger of power.   Bird of good fortune.   And the combined turtle and snake.   They as a group, have a great name: the symbols of the sky.   The starlit sky fed the rich imagination of the Ancients.   The 28 ecliptic mansions of the Chinese constellations are evenly divided into four groups: in the east, west, south, and north, with one deity representing each direction.   It said the four symbols guard the world, defending our world from the four directions.   The azure dragon is the symbol of the east.   In the traditional Chinese concept of the five phases, it belongs to wood.   The white tiger guards the west.   In the five phases theory, it belongs to metal.   The Vermilion bird is the deity controlling the south.   It belongs to fire.   The black tortoise is the combination of a turtle and a snake.   It rules the north and belongs to water in the five phases.   Its color is a combination of red and black, a unique color in ancient China.   In the Han Dynasty 2000 years ago, people believed that the Heaven and the Earth correspond to each other.   When they needed to distinguish directions, they projected the four symbols from heaven to earth.   During military expeditions, images of the four symbols will be painted on flags.   The vermilion bird acted as the vanguard, while the black tortoise was the rearguard; the left wing would have the azure dragon, and the right wing — the white tiger.   Thus the army maintained its orientation.   The four symbols appear everywhere, they were carved on the tiles when building city walls and palaces to indicate direction.   They were painted and carved on stone monuments and funeral objects.   They also appeared in more intimate settings, guarding over people's lives.   On the Jade Doorknocker, the positions of the four deities are interchangeable.   The northern and southern deities are turning to the right by the two sides of the beast's face, as if they were flying among the clouds and rendering the fierce visage, a sense of tenderness.   In the hands of the Han artists, everything becomes romantic.   In China, jade is the most precious gift given by the earth.   When artists carved the images of the four symbols, the jade becomes the connection between the earth and heaven.   Perhaps the ancients imagined they might be knocking on heaven's door.   The four symbols imbue a beautiful piece of jade with cosmic meaning.   A beautiful piece of jade is the only worthy home for such illustrious deities, guardians of the four directions and guides to far beyond.",RV-2670-2,Funeral turtle,"This funerary figure of a turtle was given to a deceased person during the Han period (221 BC - 220 AD).

Grave goods have been given to the dead since earliest Chinese history. In the past, these were mainly real (utility) objects and animals, and even servants buried alive. Pottery models were often used in the Han period. The animal figures that were buried included domestic animals, such as dogs, ducks and pigs, but also animals with a symbolic meaning. The turtle is a sacred animal in China that rules the north. It symbolizes winter and long life."
39,The Xiping Stone Classics,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. These stone fragments with worn characters has suffered the visitors of time with stoic grace.   They're spread in multiple different museum collections across China, but they still speak to one common purpose. Xiping Stone Classics date from the second century AD and the eastern Han Dynasty.   The steelies are engraved on both sides, and are the earliest official editions of china classic texts recorded in this way. There were 46 steelies in all, with seven of the Confucian classics inscribed on them with over 200,000 characters.   The Egyptian pharaohs inscribed their decrees on steely just like there was at a stone. The ancient Babylonians inscribed their laws in stone in the Code of Hammurabi.   Imperial China chose to set in stone the Confucian classics. Since the beginning of the Han Dynasty, ordinary people had been able to climb the social ladder through study.   The Confucian classics had been the models for study. There was a substantial state-run education system and a large number of private schools.   In the time before the invention of printing, the diffusion of classic works relied on transcription. Over time, mistakes were incorporated into texts through human error.   In the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, academician Caiyong led a group of scholars in petitioning the emperor in having an authoritative version of the classics engraved on stone steelies to be erected at the Imperial Academy near the Capital. The petition caused the sensation.   Ament that students and scholars could make rubbings of the steelies as definite copies of the text to take back with them to their hometowns across the Empire. The classics were engraved in the official script of the time, making them masterpieces of both art and calligraphy.   However, fortune is fickle, for masterpieces as for men. Two years after the steelies were completed, peasant rebellions began to rack the Empire.   Eventually, Luoyang was sacked in 191 AD, and the steelies seriously damaged. They were repaired during the Three Kingdoms period, get later on they drifted from place to place.   During the southern and northern dynasties, they were transferred from Luoyang to Eastman Wei capital Yedou. However on routes, they fell into the Yellow River and when they arrived in Yedou, half were missing.   During the Sui dynasty in the late sixth century, they were transferred from Yedou to the Sui capital at Changan. But once there, they were merely used as splints.   In the early Tang dynasty, when scholar statesmen wage young hoped to restore the stone classics, there were scarcely any left. Since then, in the mid 7th century, they've only been seen as scattered fragments and rubbings.   The contents of this fragment are from the II Ching Book of Changes. Through the centuries, the Chinese language has evolved.   Meaning and pronunciation change. But the characters remain the foundation of its civilization.   China's forbearers cascade into the future. Future generations recognized the past.   Xiping Stone Classics pioneered the idea of authorised, government approved editions of classic texts. Since then, every dynasty has had its own official steely inscribed to announce the definitive editions of classic works.   Words set in stone is more than just a figure of speech in Chinese culture. The steelies have proved powerful tools for later generations of scholars and researchers.   The stones are cold, and the characters still carry profound meanings. Today, more than 8,000 characters from the Xiping Stone Classics have been recovered and reassembled.   Character by character, a culture is reborn and a window on the past flung wide open.",RV-02-1092a,Inscription,"The ancient Chinese stele inscription has a long history of around 3 thousand years, which comprises an important part of Chinese traditional art and culture and stands in a significant position in the Chinese history of art and collection. The Chinese stele inscription is so rich and profound that many aspects of ancient Chinese culture can be reflected by it, such as social history, folk customs, classic language, literature, calligraphy and sculpture, etc.
The Tang Dynasty brought Chinese agricultural society into a plain prosperity at all aspects referring to politics, economy and culture. In such a promising social circumstance, arts also flourished in abundance, and the calligraphy of Tang Dynasty, especially the ""kai shu"", could be regarded as the acme of Chinese calligraphy history.
Yan Zhenqing, author of this stele inscription, was one of the greatest calligraphers in Tang Dynasty. His integrity, honesty and righteousness established a high-profiled basis for his artistic creation, because it is believed that the perfect unification of personality and artistic quality is the supreme aim in traditional Chinese art and culture. Yan dedicated his whole life to the pursuit of this ideal perfection so as to set up a brilliant exemplar for traditional Chinese literati.
His contribution to the Chinese calligraphic art consists in the creation of a brand-new calligraphic style. This new style is called ""Yan Ti""(Yan style) after his name. Totally different from the former style of elegance and fluency dated from the Jin Dynasty, "" Yan Ti"" looks decent but not stiff, fluent but not trifling, and magnificent but not extravagant. To a great extent, it promoted the artistic value of Chinese calligraphy and enriched its artistic vocabulary as well. ""Yan Ti"" took a irreplaceable position in the history of Chinese calligraphy and made Yan Zhenqing an art master and another founder of calligraphic style after Wang Xizhi.
""Yan Qin Li Bei"" was written by Yan Zhenqing himself for his grandfather who was named by Yan Qinli and inscribed in his tombstone. The content tells merits and virtues of the Yan family's ancestors and outstanding achievements of their generations in Tang Dynasty. The stele was four-sides inscribed when Yan was at the age of 71. It is the representative work in his later years and could be taken as a milestone of ""Yan Ti""'s artistic accomplishments. At present, the rest part of ""Yan Qin Li Bei"" is conserved in Xi'an Bei Lin as well."
40,Stone Carving of Confucius Meeting Laozi,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   This Han Dynasty stone relief carving depicts one of the fondest myths of Chinese culture — a meeting between the historical personage of Confucius and Lao Zi, the legendary author of the Tao Te Ching.   The figure with a wild goose is Confucius.   The wild goose is a gift presented to Lao Zi by Confucius.   A figure facing Confucius with his hand resting on a stick is Lao Zi.   Confucius meeting Lao Zi is a common theme in Han Dynasty carvings.   It's a type of artwork often used in burial chambers, tombs, and coffins during the Han Dynasty.   It expresses the way the Han Dynasty sought to integrate differing schools of Chinese philosophy.   When the meeting took place, neither Confucianism nor Taoism would have existed.   It's modeled instead, on the visit of a filial Junior to a respected senior.   In the records of the grand historian, Sima Qian, makes a detailed description of one of their conversations.   Confucius went to Luoyang to ask Lao Zi about the study of rituals.   Lao Zi said, ""As for the ritual you mentioned, the bones of the people who invented it have decayed, and only their remarks remain.   A gentleman will make contributions when fortune comes.   And if his life is unfortunate, he will drag out an ignoble existence like a grass.   Remove your arrogance and excessive desires, remove the glowing look and expression from your face, and untouchable ambitions.   These are the things that have no benefit for body or mind."" After Confucius returned home, he didn't speak for three days.   Then he said to his disciples, ""The meeting with Lao Zi was far beyond my imagination.   He is like an unpredictable dragon.   No one can perceive him completely."" After Emperor Wu of Han banished a hundred schools of thought in favor of Confucianism, there was still a move to incorporate other schools of philosophy, including those of Yin Yang and Five Element theories.   The Han sought to encapsulate this syncretic inclusivism in stone for time immemorial.   Gentlemen seek harmony but not uniformity.   It is such a delight to have friends coming from afar.   Everything comes from being, and being comes from not being.   Good fortune follows upon disaster; disaster lurks within good fortune.   From 600 BC to 300 BC, the so-called ""Axial Age"", ancient Greece ancient India and China all produced great thinkers.   The wisdom of Socrates, Plato, Sakyamuni, Confucius, Lao Zi has influenced human civilization down to this day.   Confucius and Lao Zi are the fronts of Confucianism and Daoism.   Their philosophies are like two rivers which meet the blood of the Chinese people.   It's often observed that they are Confucian in public life and Daoist in their inner hearts.   It is a judgment that each can only make for themselves.",7240-27,Rubbing painting of the “Portrait of the ancient Master and Saint perfect (Confucius),"Rubbing from a stele after the “Portrait of the ancient Master and Saint perfect (Confucius)”, dated 1734 painted by Yunli 允 礼 (1697-1738) (son of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662-1722): 至圣 先 师 像 “Portrait of the ancient Master and Saint perfect (Confucius) ”, dated 1734.

41,Changxin Palace Lamp,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. A scene of brutality, a moment of violence, a fierce tiger tearing at the rear of an ox.   Huge horns no defense against the wild beast slobbering behind her. Her fate sealed, all she can do is to try her best to shelter the innocent calf under her belly, to stave off the inevitable for a few moments.   This unique relic is one of the few remaining traces of a long-lost ancient people called the Dian, a mysterious people who inhabited the vicinity of Lake Dianchi, in what is now Yunnan province some 2,000 years ago. Little is known about them because they left no written records.   For insights into the lives of this long-lost people, we must rely on the tangible legacy they did leave behind — superb bronze wear. For example, the Tiger Ox Alter, an amazing tableau in bronze of a life-and-death struggle.   On which more than 2,000 years ago, sacrifices were made in the hope of taming the wild, seemingly uncontrollable forces that filled life with danger and uncertainty. Perhaps that's why in a sense it's so poignant.   It encapsulates the hope that those forces could be controlled, the gods could keep the wolf, or in this case, ravening tiger from the door. Your children safe, in return for a small sacrifice of course.   The tiger and ox proved an enduring motif. Fast forward a few hundred years and though the ancient kingdom of the Dian is no more.   The two animals are still with us, by now appearing on a variety of different artifacts. The narratives different, too, gone the hapless, helpless cow of the altar.   Under the eyes of two frightened monkeys and a bird. While one ox cores the tiger, the other stops it making a getaway.   Shell containers were unique in the age of Dian Kingdom. They were used by kings and nobility of the Dian Kingdom, restoring seashells and other treasures.   Whoever cast it must have been an intrepid explorer, as well as a superb craftsman. It's a meticulously well-observe depiction of the law of the jungle and action, of nature red in tooth and claw.   It contains a message, too, that there's no need to dumbly submit to the law of nature. Even the tiger, the king of beasts, may be usurped.   Starting in the Han Dynasty, around 2200 years ago, depictions of scenes from real life began appearing on shell containers like these, giving us a fascinating microcosm of life in that vanished Kingdom. Especially into the lives of its ruling class. Its Kings and Nobles.   The picture that comes across is one of Pride and prosperity, of a life revolving around sacrifices to the gods. Sacrifice is rewarded by success in battle and hunting.   So far, about 100 shell containers have been unearthed at various sites in Yunnan. The motifs on earlier examples drawn from apparently mythological sources.   Later ones more inspired by everyday life. Exactly when is not known, but at some point during the eastern Han Dynasty beginning 2,000 years ago, the ancient Dian Kingdom disappeared, leaving nothing behind, save these bronzes.   Gone, forgotten, perhaps, or perhaps not. Next time you're in Yunnan, listen out: could it be that in a sense they're still with us?   Their voices echoing through the mountains and valleys. Their spirit living on in the songs and dances of the people who live there to this very day.",RV-1119-60,Altar lamp,"A sukunda or an altar lamp from Tibet consisting of a reservoir, a handle and an oil container. The jug-shaped reservoir with a pumpkin-shaped belly stands on a bell-shaped base with decoration. The handle is in the shape of a regally dressed male figure with the feet leaning on the belly of the reservoir and the hands clasping the lip. The leaf-shaped oil container is supported by brackets against the neck and belly of the reservoir. There are two sitting lions on the edge of the oil container. On the edge of the oil container, against the neck of the reservoir, there is a vertically placed element with an image of Ganesha surrounded by a nimbus.
The sukunda is a common lamp in Nepal and Tibet. They are among the ritual utensils of temples and households. The sukunda is often lit at the beginning of an important social or religious event. Ganesha is the deity of the lamp and he ensures that all obstacles disappear. The handle can be in the shape of a makara or a naga and the oil container can be protected by images of various deities. In this case, Ganesha protects the flame of the oil container. The reservoir contains the fuel (usually ghee) for the oil pan. The required oil is transferred to the oil container using a spoon (sumicha). There is a fuse in the container."
42,Plain Unlined Gauze Gown,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   What becomes of us after death?   The Chu people who lived over 2,000 years ago believed that we enter an immortal realm.   Our traveler in time has a solemn look.   Dressed in his finery was sword at a gentleman's cap.   He rides his dragon mount into eternity.   The dragons raised head and tail, given a boat-like form.   This is indeed a voyage into the unknown.   The silk painting was made in the Warring States period, and is the earliest such found to date.   It was on Earth from the Zidanku tomb at Changsha, Hunan Province.   It rested on the boarding between the outer and the inner coffins.   It served as a pennant to lead the soul as its earthly farewell.   The canopy rises high in the air to show that the tombs occupant is wandering the skies.   A carp is leading the way from below.   The dragon is a mythical creature that can pass from this world to the next.   Oh, Soul, come back! The quarters of the world are full of harm.   Return to your old abode, your quiet and restful home.   The Chu people believe that after passing away, the earthly souls sank into the depths while the immortal spirit flew to the heavens.   The funeral's silk paintings placed between inner and outer coffins were intended to guide and protect the wandering spirit.   So it could return to earth immortal.   The T-shaped silk painting was created nearly 200 years later in the Western Han Dynasty.   It, too, was intended as a guide for the spirit of the departed.   It represents the cosmology of the people of Chu towards the end of the first millennium BC.   In the painting, life and death are joined in a dynamic cycle, like Yin and Yang.   The afterlife is governed by the same rules of time and space as the world we know.   The bottom of the silk painting depicts the underworld.   In the long darkness of night, a Titan stands on a dragon-headed fish, deters the demons and supports the earth above.   In the middle, the soul and spirit of the occupant are carried by two dragons and travel through the human world.   At the top, the gate to the heaven is wide open.   Sun and Moon shined together.   This is where the voyaging spirit will become immortal.   The inner and outer coffins are also painted with the views of the netherworld.   Although the form of life disappears for a while after death, with the blessing of sacred ritual objects, the balance of Yin and Yan can be restored.

His socio-political ethics formed the basis for the Chinese state order for more than 2,000 years.
According to his ideas, a ruler who derived his position and authority from a heavenly mandate shared his power with an elite of educated officials. They were recruited through an extensive, carefully designed and unchanged examination system for centuries - until 1905. From among them, only the best were subsequently admitted to examinations for higher positions.
Once he passed an exam at a certain level - district, prefecture, province, national government - the official was stationed in a certain place for a fixed period. There he was responsible for matters such as public works, tax collection, security and justice. In addition, he was also involved in rituals and worship for the general well-being of the population and the balance in nature.

44,Lacquer Dish with the Leopard Cat Pattern,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   After the Han Dynasty came to power in 202 BC, China enjoyed a long period of peace and increasing prosperity.   In the south, the household of chancellor of the imperial fiefdom of Changsha enjoyed many luxurious items, like this lacquer dish with leopard cat pattern.   Round eyed and round bodied, with pointy ears and scratchy claws, these leopard cats seemed rather like the domestic moggies we keep as pets today.   Yet their appearance as a pattern is not so simple.   Their fore paws are grounded firmly in perfect calm, both ears are cocked and on alert.   Their tails are pointed high as reflects their proud nature.   Their fierce eyes are marked in vermilion, giving us a glimpse of their ruthless feral hearts.   Such vivid and amusing feline imagery is a novelty of its times.   In the Western Zhou Dynasty, the belly of the Boju Bronze Cooking Vessel was decorated with bulls heads to express the power and majesty of the Monarchs.   But as the Empire prospered under the Han, a new lightness and playful frivolity became part of the spirit of the age This Lacquer Dish bares three characters: Jun Xing Shi.   If translated into modern Chinese, it means ""eat well, drink well"".   The cute kitties and simple message sit well together, both in practicality and aesthetic value.   The cats would have been seen as unbecoming to grace the tables of the aristocracy in previous ages are a sign of their times, the development of a moderately hedonistic society.   The woman at the center of the silk painting is the owner of the dish — Xinzhui, the widow of the Marquess of Dai.   This is a reconstruction of how she might have looked.   Her corpse was so well-preserved that it was able to be autopsy.   She died of a heart attack, aged around 50. She suffered from coronary heart disease and gall stones.   Her husband had died some 23 years previously.   From the autopsy, it emerged that Xinzhui's lavish lifestyle and rich diet were the main causes of her undoing, though for her times, she could be considered quite long-lived.   However, among her legacy, her items of striking and stylish beauty, which offer a unique insight into the lives of the Han Dynasty aristocracy, and the aesthetics of southern Chinese culture.   A simple blessing and playful cats would have brought a touch of warmth for Xinzhui at her table.   ""Eat well, drink well"" is a phrase as richly Chinese as it is universal.   ""Eat well, drink well"" is a blessing we all hope to enjoy and share.",RV-3205-3,Tea bowl,"Bowl with narrow base; wall at the mouth slightly curved inwards. Mottled Ji-an type stoneware from the Fujian province and made in the Song period. Glaze on the inside partly glossy, partly dull black-brown with purple reflections and many light blue-green-gray spots, fairly evenly distributed. Outside glaze less and irregularly mottled, small ""orange peel"" pits. Clay hard coarse-grained light brown burned, stoneware. Foot ring very shallow and roughly finished. Narrow bottom within slightly raised disc. Small repairs on the edge of the mouth. Also called temmoku.


Ji-an type tea bowl, also called temmoku, made in Fujian province during the Song period. The glaze has blue-green spots and shows some pits resembling an orange peel. This effect is achieved by applying a cooling technique called phase separation. Due to the slow cooling, the liquid glaze splits into two or more substances, causing the color effects and the pits (burst glass bubbles).

The special thing about Ji-an tea bowls is that they are used by everyone: simple citizens, monks, officials and even at the emperor's court. Tea was made in the Song period from blocks of pressed tea powder that were planed, boiled or poured with hot water and then whipped until a white head formed. The white foam contrasts nicely with the black bowls, according to Cai Xiang who wrote in the 11th century in Cha Lu (notes on tea) that the black bowls are therefore better than the white or green (celadon) bowls that were used in the Tang dynasty. preferred. The bowls with the hare skin and oil slick glaze are a particular favourite.
People also wrote about the use of tea in the Tang period. For example, in 760 AD, Lu Yu says in his book Cha Jing, about how to prepare tea and how to consume tea: Xing porcelain is like silver, Yue porcelain is like jade; therefore, Xing is not as good as Yue. Xing porcelain is like snow, Yue like ice; this is the second reason why Xing is not as good as Yue. Xing is white, which makes the tea appear red, Yue is green and makes the tea greener.


In Zhejiang, the neighboring province, the bowls are widely used in Buddhist monasteries. For example, Japanese monks who regularly visit the Tianmu Monasteries in the mountains are charmed by these dark and heavy bowls. They are taken to Japan and this is probably how the name temmoku came into being as a designation for this type of bowls (pronounced Tianmu in Japanese).

Chinese (WADE-GILES) CHIEN YAO, (PINYIN) JIAN YAO, also called (IN JAPAN) TEMMOKU WARE, temmoku also spelled Tenmoku, dark brown or blackish Chinese stoneware made for domestic use chiefly during the Sung dynasty (960-1279) and into the early 14th century. Chien ware was made in Fukien province, first in kilns at Chien-an and later at Chien-yang.

The clay used for Chien ware was of a very hard, coarse grain. The inside and about two-thirds of the outside is covered with a thick, very dark glaze (coloured with iron oxide) that usually stops short of the outer base in a thick welt; the glaze also tended to pool thickly on the inside of the vessel. Within its limited palette (in which a purplish or bluish black or reddish brown predominates), Chien ware has a range of variations. The most prized glazes exhibit characteristic streaking of hare's fur, the mottling of partridge markings, or silvery spotting resembling oil spots.

Teabowls are by far the most common, though not the only, form of Chien ware that survives. Used by Ch'an (Zen) Buddhist monks in the Fukien region, the highly esteemed teabowls were carried back to Japan by Japanese monks who had visited China to study Ch'an Buddhism. Until the late 16th century, Chien ware, or temmoku ware, was the type of teabowl preferred for the highly ritualized Japanese tea ceremony.

45,Counting Rods,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   If 0.5 kilograms of silk is worth 240 yuan, how much silk can we buy for 1328 yuan?   This question appears in a Chinese mathematics book composed between the 10th and 2nd centuries BC.   It worked on a decimal system we still use today.   So they could easily deal with these complicated calculations.   The decimal numeral system uses 10 decimal digits from 0 to 9 and a place value system to denote values of 10 or above.   Every natural number could be constructed in tens.   Each place to the left represents a ten times multiple of the numeral to its right.   So 8 times 10 to the power of 0; plus 1, which is multiplied by 10 to the first power; plus 0, which is multiplied by 10 to the second power; and plus 2, which is multiplied by 10 to the third power, gives the figure 2018. In pre-imperial China, such seemingly abstract figures to be expressed with some simple counting rods and from them calculations of value made.   Typically counting rods were made from bamboo, but other materials were also used, like bone, ivory, or metal.   This set of ivory counting rods was unearthed in the number-1 Han Tomb of the Yousheng Palace in Shaanxi's Shenyang County.   It has 28 rods, each of which is 0.4 centimeters in diameter, 13.5 centimeters in length.   They're all equal in size and length.   Rod numerals are expressed by placing the rods either in the perpendicular or horizontal planes.   In the perpendicular, when representing numbers from 1 to 5, each rod represents one digit.   For numbers from 6 to 9, one rod placed horizontally represents 5 and the perpendicular rods placed below represent 1. Alternatively, the numerals can be expressed by horizontal placement taking priority, only five rods are ever used.   When denoting multi-digit numbers, each digit is displayed from left to right in descending value.   0 is expressed by a gap.   Calculation with counting rods follows the same principles as the decimal system.   Add one into the higher digit when the sum of the lower digit is over ten, and one borrowed from the higher digit is regarded as ten.   When 1643 and 375 are added together, the 4 and 7 on the ten position digit make eleven.   After we add 1 on to the hundred position, it rolls up to 10. So the thousand position also needs a 1 to be added.   So we get 2018. When the rods can be handled fluently, they can be used to calculate the answer to many practical problems in building, agriculture, logistics, and warfare.   In the 16th century, the era of the counting rods came to an end to be completely replaced by the abacus.   Though the rods were replaced by beads, the decimal system rules remained unchanged.   The new technologies and improved tools have simplified calculation to the touch of a button.   But an understanding of the basis of the system remains essential.   In inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells, more than three thousand years ago, merchants could use the 13 characters for the numbers from 1 to 10 — the 100 the 1000 and the 10 thousand — to notate any natural number up to 100,000. Although recording methods have changed, the decimal system has triumphed throughout.   It's everywhere in our lives.   Decimal measurements can be used to express all the patterns and principles of science and society.   From everyday activities like shopping, to high finance, and artificial intelligence,it's all just numbers.   Numbers that we usually take as for granted as a simple bundle of sticks.",RV-360-396,Abacus,"The abacus was an indispensable tool for the Chinese merchant. Generations of European merchants have seen it used with great dexterity. They regularly took an abacus from me as a souvenir. Royer gratefully made use of the services of VOC merchants in building his museum. No doubt one of them took this abacus for Royer's museum.
The most important reference work on China in Royer's time, Du Halde's 'Description de la Chine', contained an accurate illustration and explanation of an abacus. This further contributed to making these items sought after collectibles."
46,Gold-inlaid Bronze Hill Censer,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   This mundane-looking rectangular bronze pan started a revolution.   It's a measuring vessel of Shang, the unit of a little over a fifth of a liter used for liquids or grain.   The conforming of differing standards into a single unified system was crucial to China's economic development and political psychology.   The ancient form of the character ""Sheng"" could be interpreted as a grain of rice sitting on a spoon.   Made of solid bronze, the rectangular vessel features abrupt vertical sides and a short handle.   On its outer surface, there's a 32-character inscription.   Like a birth certificate, it lists its time of creation, dimensions, and designer's name.   In this case, the designer's name is Da Liang Zao Yang, also known to history as Shangyang.   Da Liang Zao was his title as the reforming chief minister of the state of Qin.   In the fierce competition of the warring states here, each state sought to introduce a social, political, and military system that would gain it an edge over its rivals.   Shangyang believed nothing less than social revolution was required.   To enlist the support of the entire population, the first priority was to win their trust.   Legend has it that he erected a three-meter high wooden caber outside the capital south gate, and offered a reward to whoever could move it to the north gate.   No one dared try, so he increased the reward — one, two, three, four, five times.   Finally, someone was tempted and dared to move the caber.   Shangyang immediately fulfilled his promise.   Shangyang having demonstrated his trustworthiness.   The process of standardizing weights and measures could begin.   The ""Du"" was used to measure length; the ""Liang"" was used to measure capacity; the ""Heng"" was used to measure weight.   In earlier times, weights and measures varied from state to state, and even within an individual state, they could be wildly different.   Shangyang clearly defined the ""Sheng"" by producing a standard measure for it.   A simple measure that revolutionized trade and brought benefits to government and people alike.   Notably, because taxes and ties were to be paid ingrained.   Along with other reforms to encourage agriculture and military service, the state of Qin went from strength to strength.   This is the Imperial edict that was engraved onto the base of Shangyang's measuring vessel after Qin Shihuang unified China.   A total of 40 characters.   ""In 221 BC, the king of Qin overcame the last of his rivals to make himself ruler of all China, the first emperor."" A key aspect of the unification was the enforcement of universal standards in weight and measures, as well as in the writing of characters.   This has been an essential part of the glue of empire ever since.   Qin Shihuang's inscription sits two centimeters in distance and 123 years in time from those of Shang yang But in so doing, the ruler of the civilized world both implicitly and explicitly recognizes his debt to the bygone chief minister.   In a state based on a military agricultural system, a peasant household could provide men to serve or grain for taxes; and a unified measure meant a unified system for a unified state.

47,Forever Forget Me Not Silver Belt Hook,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. It's been knocked about a bit. That's to be expected after 2300 years.   Yet, scorched and battered though it undoubtedly is, on the whole, the ravages of time have been rather kind to the sheet of bronze. Look behind the dents and marks, and you can still make out the gold and silver lives of what might be the earliest surviving architectural drawing.   The plan of a proposed mausoleum for King Cuo, ruler of the state of Zhongshan, during the warring States Period. In fact, his existence is only known from inscriptions on these bronzes, which record that he dispatched troops to the state of Yan, helped put down an uprising.   The expedition was evidently successful and commemorated with a cauldron made from the spoils of war taken on the campaign. Located in what is now Hu of a province, sandwiched between two very powerful states, the affairs of her neighbors were very much Zhongshan's business in those turbulent times.   The bronze edging shows that King Cuo's ambitions weren't restricted to this life. Laid to rest in this palatial tomb complex, he would be a mighty king in death, too.   It was an ambitious scheme. The precise size and shape of each building, as well as the entire site, specified on this 96 by 48 centimeter drawing.   The drawings and plans are one thing, reality another. It's only when you take a look at the proposed site from the air that you start to get a real sense of what the King had in mind.   From his palatial tumb, Cuo would be at the center of this miniature kingdom of the dead. Sadly, perhaps, it was not meant to be — Zhongshan was destined to be wiped from the face of the earth.   Only the tombs of the king and his queen were ever completed. Poignant monuments to a king sported ambitions.   Gone, but not quite forgotten. 2,300 years later, the bronze is bearing Cuo's name resurfaced, a reminder of both of a long-forgotten footnote in the history of the warring States Period and the technological sophistication of ancient China.   What we see here is bronze of the finest quality, the work of a master craftsman with the most advanced broadcasting techniques at his fingertips. Stunningly decorated, it has a peculiarly contemporary feel to it.   Designed as a modular piece, the consists of individual parts ready to be disassembled, boxed up, taken away, at a moment's notice. This tiger is exquisitely well-observed.   The weight of the beast apparently displaced by the power of the bite inflicted on the frail fragile deer. It's also the ideal shape for a stand designed to support two fold-away screens.   These bronze tent fixtures are another good example of warring States modular design, a demonstration perhaps of just how important portability was back then. In a sense, these items embody the spirit of those times.   Invention born of necessity, flexibility essential, to surviving a ceaseless conflict of the warring States period. The time when for rulers and ruled alike, life was a constant battle, peace and repose only to be found in death.",RV-1632-23,Jade belt buckle,"jade belt buckle, in the shape of a monster head.

The dust wiped from his body and it looks defiantly ahead. Once it spent its days full of liquor, but lives in more sober times now.   It's given purpose in life was a wine vessel. Its haunches and tail are curled like a hook.   One can hold the tail and use the hooves as support when the wine is poured. The vessel's lid on its back looks like a saddle.   There are layers of wrinkles around its neck and a pair of horns adorn it snout. Its eyeballs are of the deepest black.   It's bones and muscles are well-structured. It's four hooves stand securely grounded, each with three clear toes.   It shows the craftsman knew his beasts. Sparkling gold and silver lines swirling like rainforest mist, turn into clouds and bunches of hair and true Sumatran fashion.   The gold and silver inlay technique means carving grooves on the surface of a bronze in which to inlay the gold or silver filament. It creates magnificent decorative patterns.   On this crossbow mechanism, over twenty animals — including Birds, snakes, deer, tigers and pigs — are all clearly defined. A tiger-striped in gold with upturned head and long tail.   Complex craft and durable materials demonstrate a harmony between man and nature. Different animals in many forms brought together to create vivid images of life.   Across the ages, countless lives came and went before humans appeared on earth. Images from life are as old as human civilization itself.   People made images of what they saw around them with whatever came to hand. Over 3,000 years ago, the footprints of the rhinoceros were stamped across the land of China.   It was a time when the climate was warm and humid, full of grass and trees. The kings of the Shang Dynasty are recorded as hunting rhinoceroses on the oracle bone inscriptions.   The pregnant females and juveniles were off-limits. 2,000 years ago, people in the Han Dynasty would have come across rhinoceroses in Sichuan and the southwest of China.   They were likely similar to today's Sumatran rhinoceros. As the smallest species in a rhinoceros family, it's a shy and solitary creature.   After the Western Han Dynasty, with a cooling climate and increased human population, the rhinoceroses were forced to further south. Today their range is restricted to a few isolated patches of the tropical rainforest.   Despite their banishment from China, this spirited beast still leaves its mark in memory, history, and culture.

I am a storyteller from Sichuan during the Eastern Han Dynasty, frozen at the moment my performance reaches its climax, holding a drum in my left hand and a stick in the right. I leaned forward with my back curved like a bow.   I lift up my leg high to wave my wide flat foot at the audience, that always gets a laugh. People like me are common in Sichuan.   People call us Piyo, which means comedian as you would call us today. Laughter is our game.   But it's not all laughs for us. Look at my colleague: three bands of wrinkles on his forehead, sticking out his tongue, trying his best to get a laugh.   But he was not blessed by his curved spine and a malnutrition that has left his arms short and thin, only fit to clown around. We were born with deformities, which make our bodies different from others.   Self-inflicted mockery is the best way to secure our lives and livelihood. We turn our defects into a talent to amuse.   But I'm lucky, I am immortal. 2,000 years ago, my colleagues and I were confined to eternal darkness.   Then one day, I saw sunlight again. The beautiful colors of my favorite hat had faded, though my pants are still tight at my waist.   Even with nothing to eat or drink for 2,000 years, I still maintain my figure. Losing weight was never so hard.   Chengdu is still as warm and delightful as it always was. We are blessed with a rich and prosperous culture, fine food, fine art, witty repartee and an easygoing attitude to life.   Who would not envy us? Long even before my time, some distinguished man wrote: a full record of history requires both the written works and the oral telling.   So they had it — I'm a scholar to boot. In our stories, live the founding Emperor's sword, the flying generals bow and the hearts of an innocent girl.   Passed on from generation to generation, these stories become the collective memory of the nation. My back is bowed by the weight of histories I must carry.   This is why I am so carefully looked after here. And I've been given the name — Y328A.   I am the official representative of Han Dynasty folk art. My spirit has never died.

50,Galloping Bronze Horse,"""This is a maverick horse that transcends the queues of the earth and leaps to step into the clouds, where he keeps company with the flying crows. The horse is from Leitai. Leitai is a high platform of rammed earth standing in downtown Wuwei, Gansu Province. In 1969, an Eastern Han Dynasty tomb was discovered underneath the platform, the owner of which was a general surnamed Zhang, with a spectacularly sized caravan of horses and horses lining the brick-lined chamber. Having a luxurious travelling caravan was an honour that the Han Dynasty's powerful families competed for, whether in life or in death. The honour guards were all made of bronze and included warriors 17 men, 28 servants, 14 vehicles, 1 ox, and 39 horses. 39 horses. Among the horses in the procession, there was a unique horse that was as swift as the wind. Viewed from every angle, the horse's shape was perfect, with a well-proportioned body, a strong posture, and a slightly tilted head, which seemed to emit all the strength of the body, yet appeared to be walking leisurely. This is a heavenly horse beyond the mortal world, remove the saddle and bridle restraints, free from the rider's control, it returned to freedom. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wrote in praise: ""The heavenly horse treads on the floating clouds, goes in and out of the realm of immortals and mortals, plays with the flying dragons, and sheds blood-coloured drops of sweat."" During the Han Dynasty and the Han Dynasty, the western part of the river was a paradise for mounted men and women. Wuwei, Zhangye and other four counties, there is no shortage of oases with abundant water and grass, both as a battlefield on the narrow road, but also as a heavenly pasture. At the end of the second century B.C., in order to stabilise the borders and ensure traffic, the Han Dynasty repeatedly issued orders to the Western Regions to acquire precious horses, from the West pole horse of the Wusun Kingdom to the sweat-blooded horse of the Dawan Kingdom. The Emperor of the Han Dynasty honoured the earthly steed as ""Heavenly Horse"", which was invited to cross the Great Wall and lead the generals of the Han Dynasty out of the border. Chiseling the sky, open the road, not only by virtue of manpower, but also the whims of the heavenly horse, just like shaping the colt with bare hands. Bronze galloping horse mouth, eyes, nose open, painted in vermilion, mane and tail filament back, one seems to hear hissing and wind whistling. The only support for the body of the horse's hooves, gently stepped on the back of the soaring bird of prey. The crow looks back in surprise, a theatrical fantasy, a masterpiece like no other. The horse rises up on all four hooves, its stance frozen in time, and if the seal of time were lifted, it would immediately disappear from our view. Horses are the graceful creatures of the earth, and the light messengers of the clouds. The heavenly horse travels proudly in the air, just as the human imagination travels to the ten thousand feet.

Iren's love, pointing to the flowing water, as a promise, but the fate of the mercy of the submerged current, the movement is not constant, and it is difficult to enter and stop. Though the vow with the God of Luo is close by, the traveller is hesitant and doubtful because of the different paths between man and god. The gods of heaven and earth all sigh for this meeting that ended before it began. The God of Wind holds back the cataracts and restrains the winds of dawn. The God of Water stops the waves behind the river. Feng Yi, the God of the River, plays the divine drum Nuwa sings a cool song And I finally got on the five luan and left on the six-dragon cloud car.

To the left is the Taoist goddess Magu - associated with the immortality elixir - and to her right an older man offering her a peach. The man is Shoulao, the god of longevity. The peach in itself also symbolizes longevity, because they are said to come from the magical gardens of Xi Wangmu (Queen Mother of the West).
The lines of the paintings consist of combinations of the characters xi 喜 (joy/happiness) and shou 壽 (long life).
Everything in this painting symbolizes longevity/immortality, a very important theme in Chinese culture. Many Chinese objects are decorated with symbols (such as peaches) that refer to longevity. This painting offers a different perspective on this through the tension between writing and image. It is also an interesting piece because of the way it brings together Chinese calligraphy and painting.

Together with his teacher Kang Youwei, he argued at the Chinese court for far-reaching reforms of the legal and educational systems. They found a listening ear from the Guangxu emperor, but the so-called Wuxu reforms in 1898 would ultimately fail due to fierce resistance from conservative factions. For the next 14 years, Liang lived in exile in Japan.

This calligraphy was written in the period 1914-1929. Liang had returned to China where he lived in the city of Tianjin and taught at the university. He named his writing room Yin bing shi, the ice drinker's studio. Liang had a classical education, and the name of his studio was a reference to a passage by the philosopher Zhuangzi: ""In the morning I received my orders and in the evening I drank ice water."" On the left of this roll there is a seal with this studio name.

The choice of text also stems from Liang's classical training. It is a passage from the Mencius on the value of morality. Mencius states that morality is of more importance than life and death. Liang wrote this passage for a friend and noted that in his opinion these are the most striking words of Mencius.

The calligraphy is written in the style of the Northern Wei dynasty (386-534) and has a strong archaic character. Chinese calligraphy developed in two separate directions during the period of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. In southern China, calligraphers wrote in rounded and elegant brushstrokes. In the north the characters were stocky and sharper. However, it was works from the south, such as those by the famous Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi, that would become a model for later calligraphers. In the late Qing dynasty, there was renewed interest among intellectuals in ancient writing styles. People looked for inspiration in the past to give new impetus to the present. This intellectual movement was called Jinshixue, or the study of metal and stone. So called because many of these ancient writing styles were preserved in inscriptions on bronze sacrificial vessels and stone stelae.

Around the text are various stamps by Liang, but also the stamps of different owners. On the left and right of the roll are stamps of the Dutch Sinologist Erik Zürcher. Zürcher traveled through China in 1964 and 1965 together with Gan Tjiang-tek, the then curator of China at the Museum of Ethnology. Zürcher bought this role in Beijing, one of the stops on the tour.

This means that there is nothing to do when you are alive, and you can avoid troubles without doing anything. Therefore, what you want is more than the living, and what you want to do is more than the dead. This is not just a sage, but everyone has it. A wise man will not lose his ears.

Four different representations are stamped into the clay tile using a mold: a rider on horseback, a striding man, a woman with a staff and a tree.

The figures are representative of the way in which humans and animals were depicted in China 2000 years ago. For the deceased they were a memento of his earthly past, or perhaps a preview of his heavenly future.
A dead person was not only given objects that would enable him to continue his earthly existence in the afterlife. Those who could afford it had a grave built in the form of a house. The burial complexes for the Chinese emperors were designed as underground palaces, complete with treasuries, armories and kitchens. The tombs from the Han period are an important source of archaeological information about how the Chinese lived at that time."
54,"Buddhist Statues in Longxing Temple, Qingzhou","There is a message from national treasures, please check it.   He, the reborn, has a round smiling face, just like a child's.   His cheekbones and nose rise high like mountains and hills.   His eyes and brows like ravines and rivers.   The Buddha Sculptures of Qingzhou from the northern and southern dynasties, a time when people shaped the very building blocks of the earth in their own image.   It was then that he was given birth for the first time.   The right hand stays vertically in front of the chest palm facing outward, the gesture of fearlessness known in Buddhism as the Abhaya Mudra; meanwhile, the left hand gently rests on the waist as if blessing would flow from the center of the palm to the fingertips.   A string of beads made of coral agate and other gems reflects longing for paradise, signifying a world without wars and chaos where everyone lives in abundance, the embodiment of perfection itself.   But take another look, and you'll see something sad beneath the smiling face of the Qingzhou Buddha.   Archaeological research has revealed that these sculptures have been destroyed multiple times.   In fact, over the five centuries between the Northern Wei and Northern Song dynasties, these sculptures were completely destroyed before they were buried together by the monks of the Longxing temple.   Underground, these bodies slowly disintegrated, just as the human body does.   The soul, the spirit, on the other hand, grew richer.   A look around this room reveals that all the sculptures have been repaired.   It shows the determination of human beings, their existence impermanent to give these sculptures permanence; to repair, to give them new life, and in doing so, grant themselves a form of immortality.   Fifteen centuries have passed since then.   The people whose eyes once fell upon these sculptures are long gone.   Many witnessed the process of disintegration, the color fading from the scarlet cassock, the gold foil flaking from the face.   Why didn't those people try to restore the sculpture to perfection?   Perhaps it was because they saw something significant in the countless scars of time inflicted on them, so the processes of life and history reflected in them.   Their imperfection making them more perfect.   To them, they were like fallen stars, and like us moving forward through misery.

Guanyin wears a bodhisattva crown on her head with the image of Amitabha, the heavenly Buddha, on the front. Amitabha, also called the Buddha of the West, is the heavenly counterpart of the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni. Just as Christianity has a trinity of father, son and holy spirit, Buddhism has several Buddhas who are all manifestations of one 'ultimate principle'.
In China and a number of other countries in East Asia, Guanyin is among the most popular and venerated Buddhist deities. She is worshiped as the goddess of mercy and compassion.

We enjoy each other's company, hanging by the deities and the buddha.   In pervading fragrance, we play the music as wonderfully as we dance.   Carried by monsoon, I glided towards the northern sky where there was infinity of space.   I came across an angel with wings, together, we traveled to the east where we met a feathered being who journeyed Westwood.   Our spirits enriched by wisdom of the orient.   We flew across plateaus and deserts.   Till finally, we reached a swathe of magical precipices, into the caves, we flew, dwelling in the buddha's paradise.   Countless of my kind became one entity in these caves, to be known as the Mogao Grottos, the birth of which we witnessed.   In this nirvana, we serve the buddha with flowers, music, and dance.

For over three decades, some 70 new grottos were carved into the precipices, all adorned with our dance.   Sometimes we were a singing parade, following where the flame went, grazing the rolling clouds.   Sometimes we guided the celestial beings, arousing a fleeting gale, intricate and vibrant.   Then we flew into a sea of translucent Azir, perhaps the azurite extracted from blue copper; but also, in a larger sense, the infinite freedom of our playful playfulness.   Gracefully, we strolled through gardens, meadows, pavilions, and terraces, who needs cloud, or wind, or fire, or even wings, when the overlapping and flowing of lines and spaces were sufficient for tracing our flight.

The craftsman used the branches of the walking sticks that were wrapped around the gold boshan as a support, and then bent them by hand to make a few rings of very thin gold embellishments, which were hanged on the rings in an indistinct manner, creating a sense of tremor.

You have chubby cheeks, a small nose and mouth.   You're dressed in a gown with a round neck and loose sleeves.   Though the colours of your dress have faded, they must have been really something back in your day.   Rewind to the Tang dynasty, you've just turned 10, a servant girl in a noble family.   Your life is a carefree one, we can see that from the leisurely look on your face.   You're a bit on the plump side, but times were different a millennium ago.   Your chubbiness was envied and admired.   Then you turn 14. You're a teenager now, time to follow elder girl's style and wear your hair with a little more carefree chic.   It's a style that seems to match your pleasingly plump face perfectly.   A cute double conch top knot is the favorite of the sportive girls.   You adore the dancer's hairstyles, too, those exaggerated hoops dance up and down just like the wings of butterflies.   Sometimes you'd also dress yourself up as a man and stroll confidently down the city's busiest street.   You'd help her ladyship apply makeup, powder her face, rouge her cheeks, gild her forehead with a floral design; trace eyebrows, dot the sides of her lips, paint presents on her temples, rouge her lips, and finally, the crowning glory accessorizes her hair.   If you happen to meet a Japanese envoy to Tang dynasty China, he'd tell you that styles like these were also popular among Japanese royalty.

In fact, you hardly know how lucky you are to be born a woman in the Tang dynasty.   Compared to women born in other dynasties, the world is your oyster.   So what was it that made the Tang dynasty view of women different?   There's certainly more to the story than an acceptance, even celebration of plumpness, weight and size were just one of many criteria used to assess female beauty.   Between the 7th and 10th centuries, the Tang dynasty was a time when beauty was freely expressed, an individual quality seen in the eye of the beholder.   In fact, it was the Tang dynasty's recognition of the value of the individual that made it unique in the history of ancient China.

The facial features remind one of similar little figures from the Wei period (386-557). Judging from the woman's hairstyle, with a middle parting and two knots of hair on top, one is inclined to think the piece dates from a later time, perhaps the beginning of the Tang period (618-907). The funerary statues found include examples dating from every period of Chinese history. The custom of giving the dead articles of use, and servants, as an accompaniment to life after death, dates from as early as prehistoric times. In the first centuries of our era however, real objects, animals and people were gradually replaced with pottery models of these things. Apart from this replacement, the custom itself has been maintained right up to the present. These days paper models of objects are burnt at funerals.

The Huiluo Granary was presumed to be the national granary of the Sui Dynasty. ---- Taicang For more than 1,000 years, the granary has been filled with the dust of history. Archaeologists cleared nearly 1,000 layers of silt and found the structure of the grain silo of the Sui Dynasty. The compacted base trench was dug out around the inner perimeter of the silo in the shape of a cylinder. The barn wall soil layer patted solid, fire baked, finished gold drying, paved with green paste mud seepage layer and then paved with wooden planks, bamboo mats, so that the stored grain is not easy to moisture mouldy Corn can be preserved for nine years This warehouse cellar, storage of corn about 275 tonnes, 12 handlers at all levels, are left with the name, in order to be responsible for the family along with the location of this warehouse cellar, food varieties, storage date, the total number and the source of the respective all engraved in a brick sealed under the earth When it was time to collect the grain, it was taken out and verified, and then discarded. In this granary, which is associated with ten thousand hectares of fertile land, every grain of rice has a place to come from and a place to go to. The Huiluo Cang has about 700 silos spaced 10 metres apart. They are arranged in rows from east to west and from north to south, with a cross-shaped road in the middle, dividing the four areas. There is one silo in the east and one in the west, separated by the administration area of the government office. Technically, the Huiluo silo is almost perfect. However, strategically there was a fatal flaw, it was built outside the walls of Luoyang city, during the war, the huge amount of silent food, it must be the focus of the competition. The Tang people summarised this weakness and built a warehouse in Luoyang. Adjacent to the Palace City, the Food and Garbage Storehouse, with a scale of over 400 cellars, was still in use in the Song Dynasty. Cellar No. 160 of Hanjia Cang At the time of excavation in 1971, there was corn in the bottom of the cellar, although it was charred, the organic matter was 50% Archaeologists attribute this to the scientific design of the silent cellar. This pile of charred corn should have been a full cellar when it was stored, about 250 tonnes. That's about one year's output of nearly 1,000 farmers and one year's ration for thousands of people. Remembering the heyday of Kaiyuan, there were still thousands of families in the small town. The rice was flowing with grease, the corn was white, and the public and private granaries were abundant. During the 8 years of Tang Tianbao, the grain storage capacity of the Hankia warehouse accounted for 46% of the national grain storage capacity. In Luoyang, the eastern capital of Sui and Tang dynasties, Hanjia Cang performed the duties of a storehouse. Taxes were paid in kind, salaries were also paid in kind, and the salaries of all the officials in the country came from the grain silos buried deep in the ground, the grain silo collection, storage and transportation system laid the foundation for the stability of the capital city and the operation of the country to support the prosperity of the ground.""",RV-2739-187,A stone with Tibetan script,"This stone has the saying 'Om mani padme hum' in Tibetan script. Such objects are called mani-stones. They can be found at pilgrimage sites and along the roads in the Himalayan region. With this spell, which can be popularly translated as ""Invocation of the Jewel in the Lotus,"" Buddhists invoke the help of Avalokiteshvara, the Lord of Compassion.

Avalokiteshvara is a bodhisattva, one who has postponed his own Buddhahood to help other people attain Enlightenment. Avalokiteshvara is the bodhisattva who takes care of the welfare of the world in the present age.

64,Iron Oxen along the Yellow River,"""In the twelfth year of the Tang dynasty, an infrastructure project was launched as a national strategy it was a costly project. In fact, four-fifths of the country's iron production that year was eaten up by this infrastructure project, about |100 tonnes This is the Yellow River Iron Bull, the piers of the Bejingdu Floating Bridge The Bejingdu Pontoon Bridge is not well known today, but during the Tang Dynasty, it was the lifeblood of the nation's transport. Salt from the east of the river, iron from the west of Shanxi, grain from the centre of the country, and troops to defend the capital were all assembled here, so the piers of this pontoon bridge were vital. The pontoon bridge floats on the river, and the key point of stress is the piles on the bank Under the ground, the combined power of the Tang Empire is buried Under the ground, six iron pillars with barbs were stuck into the ground, and the pillars were purposely tilted, and then Newton's law kicked in. Newton's law kicked in and the gravity of the iron oxen and the tension of the pontoon bridge created a greater combined force and the greater the tension, the deeper the iron pillars sank into the ground and the stronger the bridge piles were This was an amazing design. Today we know that Action and reaction forces are equal in size and opposite in direction and at that time In order to get the crazy idea of bridge design off the ground. The road engineers of the Tang Empire joined the fight. In order to make the iron anchor post sink deeper and deeper, it was surrounded by a large number of stone blocks the anchor post would sink, the stone blocks would lift up, still tightly wrapped around the anchor branch so that the whole project could move within a reasonable range and would not be destroyed by the instantaneous force of the Yellow River the Yellow River Iron Bull, which synthesised metallurgy, mechanics, architecture, and road engineering, was also very honourable the pontoon bridge over Po Tsun Du which was burdened with its burden, Anjin, was in use for 3,500 years Because of the Yellow River diversion, finally did not into the mud and sand. According to today's international construction standards Bridges have a life span of no less than 7‡ to 100 years Until today, 1300 years later The stress structure of the Yellow River's iron oxen, which serve as the bridge's anchors, is still intact. This exceeds modern standards by a factor of 13. It's impossible to calculate How many people stepped on this pontoon bridge during the Tang Dynasty? Feeling the pressure of the Yellow River's fury on the palms of their feet. How many scholars, soldiers and merchants came to Chang'an? Looked at this stronghold of the river, and wondered why the Tang Dynasty was so strong. Today, we use oxen as a metaphor for stubbornness, we use oxen to describe stubbornness also used to evaluate the ability to praise the people we admire the Yellow River Iron Ox, may be the world's longest overtime oxen they use the iron rope to pull up the Pu Jin Du pontoon bridge witnessed the diversion of the Yellow River, the flow of time The Yellow River Iron Ox may be the most inspirational ox in history still stands silently on the banks of the Yellow River, watching the river and mountains remain the same.""",RV-2161-2,Funeral figure of a cow,"This funerary figure of a bovine was given to a deceased person in the Tang period (618-907). A cattle was a valuable animal. As a draft animal, the ox was indispensable to Chinese farmers and the animal is therefore the symbol of agriculture.

According to Chinese beliefs, life after death is a continuation of earthly existence. The deceased needs the same things in the afterlife as before. Grave goods have been given to the dead since earliest Chinese history. In the past, these were mainly real utensils, animals and sometimes even servants buried alive. However, in the Tang period, pottery models were used. The animal figures that were buried include domestic animals such as dogs, ducks and pigs.

65,Tablet for Roman Nestorianism in China,"""The sea branch and the stone rot, used to be our most ancient imagination about time we carved the words on the stone Expecting it to carry our stories through time this compound at the root of Xi'an's southern city wall has preserved thousands of treasured steles since the Eastern Han Dynasty forming a forest of monuments Each stone tablet is like a door in time. The Chinese language's shuzo and vocabulary tell the story of the creation of the world in the Bible, and the word for God in the text is ""he"", which means God, Jehovah. Sunday, 4 February 781 A.D. A stone monument was erected on the grounds of the Da Qin Temple, the first church ever built in China, in Yi Ning Fang, Chang'an, the capital city. The cross, the symbol of Christianity, is carved between the hard heads of traditional Chinese chi dragons. Lilies and flying clouds surround it on both sides. Below the cross is an inscription in regular script ---- Da Qin Nestorianism Popular Chinese Monument Nestorianism was a separate sect from early Christianity in the fifth century AD, the Nestorians. originated in the Eastern Roman Empire The ancient Chinese and Tang dynasty texts refer to this empire, which mirrored the East, as the Da Qin Nestorian Stele, a golden inscription with 1,780 double characters written in regular script, a model of calligraphy There are also 21 lines of Syriac text The inscription begins with the praise of God and the teachings of Nestorianism. It then reviews the 146 years of Nestorianism in the Tang Dynasty. In 635 A.D., Prime Minister Fang Xuanling was ordered by Emperor Taizong to welcome Nestorian priests from Persia to the western suburbs of Chang'an. ---- The Tang empire embraced a wide range of interpretations of the world, including indigenous Taoism, foreign religions Nestorianism, like native Taoism, foreign Buddhism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism, added another colour to the Tang imagination of life. Aroben and his party were allowed to translate the Bible in the Emperor's library. The Christian sect that first came to Tang soon had a new name. As the character Jing has the meaning of light, people named it Jing Numbers The inscription was written by the court councilor Lu Xiuyan It was written by Jing Jing, a Persian who had lived in Chang'an since he was a child, and he borrowed a lot of Chinese concepts in order to stay close to Chinese thinking. In order to be close to Chinese thinking, he borrowed a lot from Chinese concepts, not only quoting scriptures, but also calling churches temples and gods as monks. As a precious code to find out the change and flow of this ancient sect it is a door of time to witness the exchange of civilisations. That Jing character, it has seen the glowing Great Tang.""",RV-762-2b,Rubbing print,"The invention of paper (ca. 100 AD) offered the Chinese new possibilities for reproducing texts. One of the new uses was making impressions of existing inscriptions on large stone columns. Buddhists in particular had a great need for such rubbings to spread their faith. They consider it a good deed to distribute copies of pious sayings to the faithful.

To make a rubbing print, the paper is wet and then stuck to the inscribed stone. The paper is pressed firmly with a coconut fiber brush. The paper is then padded with a pad soaked in ink. In negative, the characters of the inscription appear on the paper.
Inscription texts are still copied in this way, and not only by Buddhists. The advantage of this method is that the inscription itself is not damaged."

He has the body of a horse, sitting on his hind legs, with wings attached to his shoulders.

Such beings were given to the dead as a protector. They accompanied the spirit on its journey to the Western World, the afterlife. With their terrifying appearance they kept evil spirits at bay.
The Chinese representation of Yama is a mixture of Buddhist and Taoist elements. Yama rules the underworld, where all the deceased are judged. Anyone who has lived well may return to earth as a human being. Those who have lived badly return as animals. The greatest sinners are subjected to severe punishment in hell."

With its head thrown back, mouth open, tongue rolled up as if about to break into song, and a platform inches wide with a miniature of an eight-person band perched atop its humps, it looks like the circus came to town when this camel arrived.   This sancai camel unearthed in 1959 from a Tang era tomb in zhongbao village on the western outskirts of Xi'an is a perfect specimen of a Tang sancai pottery figure. Sancai is a type of low temp lead-glazed earthenware.   The glaze was mixed with metal oxides containing copper iron and cobalt, resulting in an array of different colours. Thanks to fluctuating temperatures during the firing process, as most such pieces exhibit three dominant pure colours, these ceramics are called three colours or sancai in Chinese.   Sancai were used for burial objects, a product of elaborate funeral rituals during Tang's glory days. This artwork, an unintended treasure dazzling with radiant colours, becomes a symbol of the great Tang dynasty.   Camels trudged miles from the western regions, bringing good wine and gems, as well as instruments, melodies, and popular tunes. On the back of the camel, a lozenge patterned blanket is laid.   Seven male musicians wearing top knot cloth in round collar and tight cuff robes are perched atop. They sit cross-legged, facing outward, playing their instruments passionately.   The instruments include clappers, an important rhythm instrument that produces a crisp sound. Pipa conveys the theme of the song, the bold strings rattle like splatters of sudden rain, the fine strings hum like lovers whispers.   Panpipes shaped like a phoenix's wing, sound elegant like the flowing clouds. Hengdi, melodious and smooth.   Xiao, etherial and haunting.

Her right-hand reaches forward and left-hand swings back, lips slightly parted, she seems to be singing. In the golden years of Tang, China was a splendid and gorgeous land.   Emperor Xuanzong set up imperial music academies and operatic circles that brought new excitement to the palace. He also issued an edict ordering the convergence of Taoist, Buddhist, and foreign music and reinstated the seated and standing performances.   This emperor, who was an expert in Jiegu drums an ancient western percussion instrument, was regarded as a promoter of musical genre that crossed ethnic boundaries, fusing different types of music.

69,"Celadon Ewer with Brown Poetry Design, Changsha Ware","The earth is like an hourglass, counting the sequence of dynasties, obliterating the ""insignificant"" data, and when everything turns to dust, who can prove that ordinary people have loved each other? A wine pot, with twenty words, recorded the love of a generation. It can be assumed that this wine pot was once given by a pair of lovers to each other as a final farewell on the occasion of their parting, and that the uncertainty of the future prevented them from making any promises, and that they could only think of it in their hearts, and that they would never leave each other for a thousand miles. The poem describes, in plain English, a relationship tested by distance, and the details of the body suggest that this kind of longing is very common, and the Changsha kilns have a large number of surviving pots in the classic Tang dynasty style of wine pots, with the mouths of these jugs wide open, and their backs mounted. The simplicity of the design suggests that they were low-cost, everyday objects that could be consumed by the common people of the time, and it's for this reason that the lines on the pots were so widely sung, ""Birds fly in the plains, people follow the flowing water, white clouds, thousands of miles, the bright moon, the streams before and the streams after."" The white clouds, the flowing water, the birds, the journeys, the Tang dynasty used the Chinese characters to calculate the unknown, to count thousands of miles, to count the months of a year, but not to calculate the distance of the human heart. Mass-produced porcelain means that such uncertainty was commonplace, and the sinking of an ocean-going merchant ship off the coast of present-day Indonesia in the 9th century A.D. 56,000 pieces of Changsha kiln porcelain confirm the prosperity of China's cities during the late Tang dynasty, and it's fair to speculate that the Changsha kiln's poetry pots were widely used in the Tang empire's inns, and at the stagecoaches, to provide a bit of candlelight for drunken travellers, and that more choices, faster transportation, allowed people to travel further, and also made breaking up an easy task, and that the Tang people had a better chance of getting away from each other. It also made breakups a breeze, so you can imagine how many people longed for ordinary love in a time when goodbyes were easy, and time settled in the dirt, making it impossible to prove love or non-love, and a thousand miles to go, and goodbyes in the twilight of our lives.",RV-2917-35,Celadon bowl,"This celadon bowl is decorated with ribs. Celadon is the European name for earthenware with a sea green glaze. The name is taken from the hero of a French pastoral novel, who wore a sea-green cloak. In China this pottery is called Longquan, after one of the most important places where it was made.

This Song period bowl was found in Thanh Hoa, Tonkin Province, Vietnam. In the thirteenth century, China was ravaged by invasions and wars. Many South Chinese potters therefore fled to Vietnam. The Chinese influences on the Vietnamese ceramics industry are unmistakable.

70,Astana Paintings of Fuxi and Nvwa,"This is an ancient land with high and spacious terrain. In 48 B.C., the Western Han Dynasty set up Gaochangbi in the Turpan area. In the Tang Dynasty, it was the centre of Xizhou and Jiaoha County, and twice became the seat of the Anxi Prefecture, and for more than 800 years, a large number of immigrants from the Central Plains came to this land, either to guard the borders or to escape from the chaos, and lived and prospered here. The Gobi sand dunes of more than 10 kilometres between the Flaming Mountain and the old city of Gaochang are the resting place of the ancient Gaochang inhabitants from the Western Jin Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty. It is an ancient sky with bright stars, and between the stars are the common Chinese beliefs in the goddesses Fuxi and Nuwa. Since 1959, more than 100 similarly shaped Fuxi and Nuwa images have been unearthed at the Astana Tomb Complex, dating from roughly the 6th to the 8th centuries AD. The images were made of silk or linen, in the shape of an inverted trapezoid, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, and were hung on top of the tombs or covered with coffins. With the sky above, the earth below, and the people living in it, the deep darkness of the tomb is transformed into a bright universe in which the tomb owner lives in eternal bliss through the symbolic simulation of the sky in the starry night sky. The belief in Fuxi and Nuwa first appeared in the pre-Qin Dynasty, and during the Western Han Dynasty, due to the influence of the yin and yang doctrine, Fuxi and Nuwa began to appear in the form of dyadic deities, representing the opposite of yin and yang and the endlessness of life. The human-headed, snake-bodied Fuxi and Nuwa have snake-tailed lower bodies, entwined in a spiral structure, with short pleated skirts around their waists, and both are wearing large-sleeved upper jackets with rounded collars and large sleeves with valance prints on a red background with black borders. Fuxi is on the right and Nüwa on the left, opposite each other, distinguished only by their make-up and headdresses. Nuwa holds a rule in her right hand and four counting chips for calculations in her left; Fuxi holds a rule in his left hand and an inkwell for flicking ink lines in his right. If the serpentine body with interlocking tails symbolises the desire for survival and reproduction, and represents the birth of all things after the creation of heaven and earth, then the rules, the square and circle, the sun and the moon, and the yin and yang symbolise the rationality and will of a civilisation that set the square and circle for the unknown and gave the world its scale at the time when the chaos was first opened. Following the footsteps of immigrants, cultural genes from the Central Plains have taken root in this distant land, and the image of Fuxi and Nuwa has fissioned into more diversified memories and images as the four directions mingle and time changes. Cultural transmutation occurs in collision and precipitation in integration. Through a picture of Fuxi and Nuwa, the dead finally return to the sky where the ancestral gods protect them. Though the world is like a dog and life withers away, the stretching of life in pursuit of eternity and splendour in the midst of impermanence is preserved in our cultural memory. I can't see my homeland with my eyes, but when I look up, I see the same starry sky.",RV-4056-1,Ancestor portraits,"Ancestor portraits - in this case of a woman - are highly formalized. The sitting posture, the deceased's expensive formal clothing and the immediate surroundings are virtually the same in all portraits. Only the facial features show somewhat personal characteristics.

Such ancestor portraits were often - and sometimes still - hung in a separate room of the house. There they honor the deceased with incense, prayers and offerings. The function of the portrait is comparable to that of a soul tablet. It serves as a seat for the soul of the deceased when the body is buried. Ancestor worship is a very living tradition in modern-day China. Most houses have a room or corner set up for this purpose. Nowadays, instead of a painted portrait, a photo of the deceased is often hung."
71,Gilded Bronze Dragon with an Iron Core,"""This is a dragon of the Tang dynasty. The body of the dragon is made of copper, with an iron core inside the copper, and the surface is gilt all over; the body of the dragon is bent in the shape of an S, the head is high, and the long horns with three knotted forks are extended backward, close to the top of the head; the mouth is wide open, revealing sharp teeth, and the long tongue curls upward inside the mouth, and the tip of the tongue is on top of the palate, the eyes are rounded and shining; the forelimbs are stirred up straight, and the front paws are bent, and forcefully landed on the ground, and the limb and paw bones and knuckles are extremely clear, concealing the beauty of the power brought by the power; the lower abdomen, the hind limbs and the slender The lower abdomen, hind limbs and slender tail are floating, with two auspicious clouds on its back, as if it is descending from the sky. Gilding is one of the most superb crafts in ancient China, which is characterised by an extremely thin layer of gilding, which fits tightly with the original object, so that no intentional decoration can be seen, especially when the whole body is treated with the gilding process, which is almost exactly the same as that of a gold object. But this flying dragon in the Tang dynasty metal casting artefacts is extremely rare. Iron cast inner core, iron on copper, copper and then gilt, this process let it have a noble coat, the use of iron and copper is to make the shape more tough stretch, the craftsman therefore has more soaring creative space. In the eyes of the Tang people, dragons were auspicious animals. When the ancient Chinese observed the sky at night, they found that the stars in the east, namely Horn, Kang, Dui, Fang, Xin, Tail and Kei, were linked together in the image of a dragon, so they called these stars ""Dragon Star"" to express their worship of the dragon. The Tang people believed that the dragon could bring their wishes to heaven, so the Tang people were keen to hold the ceremony of throwing the dragon to pray for blessings, they will be written in the blessings or wishes of the text and jade jade, gold dragons, gold buttons tied with green silk, thrown into the mountains and rivers in the hope of getting the response of heaven. The Tang people carved the dragon's posture into bronze mirrors and wove the dragon's patterns into silk, and the dragon turned its face and sleeves into the sky. Dragons also flew into the Tang poetry, whether it is Du Fu's ""Ssu nine real dragons, a wash of the ancient mortal horse empty"", or Li Bai's ""riding a flying dragon ear wind, across the river across the sea and the sky"", the words are full of the Tang's ethereal temperament. Li Ying's sentence ""four dynasties worry about the country sideburns like silk, the spirit of the dragon and horse sea crane posture"", let the word ""dragon and horse spirit"" has become a synonym for full of vitality. The gilt iron core bronze dragon flies down to the sky, light and heavy, flowing and powerful, fixed in a moment. Thousands of years have passed, the grand palaces have turned to dust, the streets of Chang'an have become ashes, the winds and clouds have changed, but the flying dragon has not changed its look, and when you listen to it, its roar is the deep echo of the ancient civilisation.""",RV-1860-4,Tea pot,"Tea was served from this pot to monks during ceremonies. This teapot is a mix of styles. It comes from Tibet but the shape is Mongolian and the decoration is Chinese.

The shape of this teapot is Mongolian and is quite different from that of Tibetan teapots. The decorative motifs show strong Chinese influences, such as the dragon on the handle.
The Mongols, originally a steppe people from Central Asia, conquered large parts of Asia in the thirteenth century. Mongol emperors ruled China from 1271 to 1368. In Tibet they came into contact with Tibetan Buddhism. A mixed culture emerged, in which Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan elements mixed together."
72,Tang Painted Figurines of the Chinese Zodiac,"There is a message from national treasures, please check it. At the end of each year of the traditional Chinese lunar calendar, there is a transfer of duty between two animals.   The animal in charge of the old year hands over responsibility to the one in charge of the new year. There are 12 animals in order, starting with the mouse and ending with the pig.   Over a repeating cycle of 12 years, each animal is on duty for one year. The chinese zodiac emerged as a tradition during China's spring and autumn period around the 5th century BC.   As gods of time, the animals of the chinese zodiac are also in charge of the twelve two-hour periods that traditionally make up each day. From mouse to pig, they take their shift one after another.   During the Tang dynasty, between the 7th and 10th centuries, the 12 zodiac animals timekeeping duty extended even beyond this world. Under the Tang emperors, the animals of the zodiac were represented in a variety of ways.   The figurines of the collection of the Xiangxi history museum have an animal head and human body, dressed in a Tang style long robe with wide sleeves, heads slightly lifted, their expression is solemn, like officials in attendance at the royal court. When these animals real or imaginary are given a human body, they became guardians for every soul.   In myths throughout history, animals often appear in human form. While other animal deities and demons often raise havoc, the timekeeping zodiac animals have been orderly and down to earth.   On occasion, they have been known to visit people and confront them for eating an animal of their kind. Eating goat heads doesn't sound like a serious crime, but in the Tang dynasty, you just might have a neatly dressed god with a goat's head and a man's body pay you a visit.   This is a warning: I am god of the way hour, corresponding to the zodiac animal goat. I heard that you like eating goat heads, so I came to tell you to stop or I'm going to kill you.   The animal god who was protective for fellow goats presented himself as ""god of the way hour"", referring to a traditional ancient time-keeping system, known as the heavenly stems and earthly branches. As gods of time, the sequence following the order of the twelve zodiac animals is in accordance with the earthly branches.   When the double hour periods starting at 11 pm, 1am, 3am, and 5 am came to be associated with the mouse, the ox, the tiger, and the rabbit respectively. A complicated time-keeping system became simple and personal when attached to animals people were familiar with.   The 12 zodiac animals corresponding to 12 2-hour periods, 12 months and a repeating cycle of 12 years are with the Chinese people all the time. Having endured for over a thousand years, the tradition of time-keeping according to zodiac animals continues today.   With each zodiac animal associated with a year, everyone is born with a zodiac sign. The 12 zodiac animals then are not just our guardians but our companions, too.",RV-2068-1,Funeral figure,"This grave figure represents a bird, with a human body and a long robe. The statue was given to a deceased person in the Tang period (618-906). It is difficult to determine which bird is depicted here. It may be a duck, a bird that is still widely eaten in China. Moreover, it is a symbol of happiness and marital fidelity.

According to Chinese beliefs, life after death is a continuation of earthly existence. The deceased needs the same things in the afterlife as before. Grave goods have been given to the dead since earliest Chinese history. In the past, these were mainly real utensils, animals and sometimes even servants buried alive. However, in the Tang period, pottery models were used. The animal figures that were buried include domestic animals such as dogs, ducks and pigs."
73,Agate Cup with Gold-Inlaid Beast Head,"""In November of the ninth year of the Tang's reign, a Cornish envoy from the Central Asian state of Kang arrived in Chang'an, where they presented the Tang Emperor Li Shimin with a golden peach as large as a goose egg and as golden in colour. The taste of this fruit in the end, we have no way to speculate, but those who have been accompanied by its luxury into the Tang Dynasty is still glittering. Inlaid with gold animal head agate cup is a wine vessel, agate is a gelatinous mineral, although China also produces, but the literature said agate, is mostly from the foreign treasure. Large agates are extremely rare and are hollowed out into hollow cups, with a singular intent. The base of the agate cup is reddish in colour, with a yellowish-white stone texture that resembles the markings of an animal. The carver carved the head of the animal at the small end, and the mouth and nose are set with a gold cap that is removable. Most scholars believe that this cup, with the animal's head at the end and the whole in the shape of a horn, is what is known in the West as a ""laiton"". It appeared as early as the Assyrian Empire in the Two Rivers Valley and during the Achaemenid dynasty in Persia. In the Greek belief in the god of wine, the horned cup was a sacred object, with which wine could be poured to prevent poisoning. People held up the Laiton filled with wine so that the wine was left through the small holes and injected into their mouths like silk threads, and if they drank it all in one go, they were paying homage to the god of wine. It has been speculated that the animal head agate cups probably first followed the flow of the Suit caravans into the Central Plains as well. The people of Sut loved wine, so they brought grape cultivation and wine-making techniques, and also brought the wine culture of the western region into the Great Tang. In the banquet scene of the Sut people, often appear animal head horn-shaped wine set, their coffins are also inscribed on the stone carvings of those who drank the moment of sound. In addition to fine wine and drinking utensils, the cheetahs in the royal hunting party, the whisky dogs played by court ladies, and all kinds of hu clothes, hu food, BMWs, and precious stones were all transferred by the Sutis from the western countries. From the 6th to the 9th centuries AD, wealth, exotic animals and jewellery from all over Asia were transported to the land of the Great Tang by land and sea. Along with these imports came not only the Suites, but also the Persians, who brought with them new technologies and arts, and those exotic, open, exquisite, and bewitching beauty instantly conquered the Great Tang. The gold-encrusted animal head onyx cup, unearthed on 5 October 1970 on an infrastructure site in Hejiacun, a southern suburb of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, along with more than 1,000 artefacts, is the famous Hejiacun Tang Dynasty cellar. The gold wire coiled with layers of petals, regimental flowers, divine birds spreading their wings and cocking their tail feathers, and dancing horses with cups as drunk as mud. Exquisite decorations, exquisite craftsmanship, sun-like gold, moonlight silver and exotic imports, reflecting the most dazzling era in Chinese history.

The jug is decorated with lotus leaves. The lotus leaf motif is very common on all kinds of tableware, especially everyday tableware.

The lotus is depicted in China in all its stages of growth: in the bud, as an open flower, with only the petals and in the form of the seed pod. In this last form it symbolizes numerous offspring because of the many large seeds. In general, the lotus symbolizes summer, the season of abundance."

The bowl bears the Daoguang seal, which means that it was made between 1821 and 1851.

There are all kinds of Taoist legends about the Eight Immortals. The eight owe their immortality to studying the secrets of nature or performing a remarkable or good deed. They each represent a facet of human life: old age, youth, wealth, poverty, femininity, masculinity, aristocracy and humble origins. They are often depicted on ceramics, together or separately. The Immortals are recognizable by their attributes, such as a flower basket, a peach, a flute, a lotus, a fan, castanets, a magical sword and a gourd.
Also on the inside of the bowl are some symbols of luck and immortality. Anyone who gives such a bowl as a gift wishes the recipient a long life. That could be someone dear, but also a civil servant. In ancient China it was very common to give gifts to high officials, on the one hand out of respect, and on the other hand with the hope of benefiting themselves.

75,Dunhuang Sutra Illustrations,"""Every time the sunrise cuts through the dust and illuminates the cool walls of the grotto, the colours from the Tang Dynasty awaken. Huge halls like mountain peaks towering, along the axis from front to back into three, beams and columns dense, steep roofs, high buildings around the pavilions and terraces lined up, plazas and corridors winding connection, Buddha appeared in the centre of the complex, sitting with eyes downcast, flanked by bodhisattvas and celestial maidens. Dunhuang Mogao Cave 172 north wall of the ""view of infinite life sutra changes"" painted in the Sheng Tang Dynasty, depicting the Amitabha Buddha resides in the Western Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss. The sutra variations are based on Buddhist scriptures, and in order to convey the meaning of the sutras to the world, they depict the world of the Buddha in all its aspects. Dunhuang's Tang dynasty sutra paintings often drew on the styles of famous artists from the Central Plains, rendering the stories of the sutras in large, stately images. The world of bliss in the sutra paintings is like a spiritual portal created by the Tang, where visions are created out of dust and neon dresses are danced in this place. The steps are straight and seemingly in front of the eyes, as if people in the mortal world only need to take one step forward along the ladder to log into the world of bliss. Carved railings and jade masonry, flowers and foliage, birds and birds gather, look at the umbrella cover from afar, close to the incense burner, are the treasures that can only be made by the palace. The kabuki procession, with foot-coloured carpets and dancing, is taken from the Western custom. The fantasy world in the Buddhist scriptures has become a reality under the brush of the painter, a fascinating land of pleasure, more and more like the memory of the wonders of Chang'an. The focus of vision back to the near, as if in the blink of an eye, the heavenly maiden raised her arm to light up the lamp tree, a time of twilight fire bright, this is not exactly the Chang'an Shangyuan lantern festival of the spectacle?

Crowds of people in fancy dress and different masks chase the flowing light, wandering like fish and dragons in the sea in limitless joy. The splendour of mundane life and the superimposition of the world of faith generate the illusion of ultimate happiness. Celestials are like the world, and the other shore is so born. The other shore of the Tang's dream of Buddha's kingdom is the gateway for us to return to our homeland.

It is apparently Ciwa as Mahecwara ( ), cf. v.Siebold, Pantheon of Nippon, p.139, fig.499. Below Ciwa we see Awalokitecwara (Kwan Yin, ) with a vial of amrta in the left hand and a scroll (a sutra) in the right hand. Shown as a woman with a hood. Below Kwan Yin we see a deity sitting on horseback with a raised sword. The horse is reminiscent of Hayagriva, the god of hell, but its appearance is more reminiscent of Majucri. If it is Hayagriva then the little boy with the throwing ring and spear is certainly Sudhannakunara. The woman with the fly fan to the left of the boy is probably the Dalim Vajravarah, mentioned by Grunwedel (Myth. des Buddhismus in Tibet, p. 164) as collaborating with Hayagriva. But it could also be Yami, Yama's twin sister and consort, who judges women, just as Yama rules men, or Fujenma, goddess of the blood pool, into which women who die in childbirth are thrown. Or it is Mother Meng, mentioned in the Yuh lih as a pious woman of the first Han dynasty, who was appointed hell goddess by Shang-ti and there makes those who are reborn drink the drink of oblivion, so that they do not mind anything. remembering their past life and also having a foreboding of the retaliation, which is more likely to lead them to virtue. To the right of the boy we see a Garuda-like figure, with wings, claws and a beak-like mouth. He has a crown on his head.

76,Jingdezhen Kiln Blue And White Glaze Bowl With Incised Baby's Play Pattern,"The earliest human ""bowls"" were scooped up hands. The hand is the flexible, sensitive end of the body, and the bowl becomes an extension of the hand. Raising a bowl is just a mundane routine. By putting down the bowl, mankind was relieved of hunger and thirst, and welcomed the growth of life. In the beginning, humans tried to make bowls out of wood, light but perishable; by applying lacquer to the surface of the wood, it became durable and beautiful. Man invented pottery by roasting earth with fire; the sturdy bowl came from water and fire, and was good at living with them. Later, finer earth and fiercer fire gave birth to porcelain; porcelain bowls were born, at the forefront of their time, and have yet to be surpassed by time.

Countless times we peered into the bowl, lifting it with our hands to our lips to drink and eat, the material of the bowl's body, the lines of its walls, the thickness of its mouth for our bodies to perceive. Sometimes we resort to spoons and chopsticks to help water or food to enter, to build bridges from the bowl to the person, to write the laws and legends of etiquette. We constantly remould the shape and size of the bowl using our bodies as a yardstick. As food is cooked hot, the bottom of the bowl slowly rises. When the bowl's capacity increases, the hand that holds it spreads wide. As our eyes rest on the inside and outside of the bowl, the bowl takes on a colourful decoration. The need to depict or write is only as far as the eye can reach. Forever hollow, the bowl was designed to achieve containment, to preserve the history of human sensory experience and to hold the details of civilisation.

77,White-Glazed Child's Pillow From Ding Kiln,"""Early summer, late and cool. The boy, still a little baby-faced, was lying prone on a couch in a robe over a kangaroo. His arms were encircled and his head was tilted up. His forehead was open, his face plump, his lips thick and his ears large. His two calves are crossed and upturned, and he grasps an embroidered ball in his hand in casual mischief. The perimeter of the bed and couch was moulded with chi dragons and Ruyi cloud heads, and the boy lay on top of them in this way, languid and idle. Born in the Song Dynasty, he never grew up.

Child pillow is the Northern Song Dynasty craftsmen in the art of modelling a major creation, but also a typical style of Song Dynasty porcelain pillow. But why is the pillow made into a child's appearance? About the image of the sea child pillow, there is such a speculation. Every Tanabata Festival, the Song Dynasty streets and alleys will sell a different shape of human dolls, known as ""grinding drink music"". Tokyo Dreaming Records"" in such a description, Tanabata three or five days before, children need to buy a new lotus leaves to hold, cover the smile knit ""grinding drink music"". This custom has been passed down for a long time. The ""Grind and Drink"", also known as the ""Mo Shuo Luo"", comes from the Buddhist scriptures and has the appearance of an evil god, but after entering the Middle Kingdom, he turned into a cute child. It is also said that ""Mashura"" is a corruption of ""Rahula"", who was the child of the Buddha. The Buddha's children, perhaps this is how the Song people saw them. They are the source of life, our nature, full of countless possibilities. He sometimes appears as a child who guides us when we are lost, and sometimes as a shepherd boy who meets us when we are at ease. They are under the pine tree, they are in the moonlight, they are by the stream, they are our childhood. The Song people's desire for heirs was stronger than that of any other dynasty before them, thanks to the diversity of their society, their cultural prosperity, their economic affluence, and the comfort of their lives. The painting ""A Hundred Children Playing in Spring,"" also from the Song Dynasty, depicts more than a hundred children playing on a high platform. The two-tiered high platform is divided into different functional areas by the children, with the children on the high platform releasing paper kites, enjoying calligraphy and painting, playing chess, and playing the zither, while the children under the high platform are saluting the Buddha, acting out shadow puppets, playing with lions, and climbing trees. The children in the Hundred Children's Picture Universe, in the courtyard of heaven and earth, in the game of time and life and death, play to their heart's content, without beginning, without end, without worry.

This tall standing landscape, originally applied to a decorative screen, was perhaps a favourite in the palace city of Bianjing. Outside the frame, the four seasons have come and gone, day and night have alternated, and the city has become bustling. Inside the frame, the season has not changed, sealing a spring day in the hearts of Song people. At the foot of the mountain, the streams have thawed and the water vapour is rising. Mountain streams and trees are sprouting new buds, the sound of water ripples, seem to hear the wooden boat touching the shore. Boatman looked up and looked out, the mountain as if the earth's giant, like ""the bones of heaven and earth"". From the bottom up, towering peaks through the wisps of smoke and clouds; from the front and back, jagged rocks hide in layers of mist; from near and far, far away, is the sky and the earth is boundless. The mountain road is winding and the spring is flowing. Vaguely, three or two rows of mountain men walk in song. Wooden bridges, grass pavilions, flying eaves, human traces and natural overlap together, hidden and visible. Walking to the top of the mountain, as if hearing the immortal whispering, touching is the stars of the past. When Guo Xi was young, he respected Taoist thinking and loved to travel around the mountains and rivers, just like the former great masters Jing Hao, Li Cheng and Fan Kuan. They were inspired by the idea of resting their bodies and minds between the earth and the sky, and by the idea of learning from nature. From the world to the forest spring, the visual miracle of the painters all depends on the chest of the weather, through the brush will be the continuation of landscapes to the courtyard or hall, enough to ""do not go to the hall feast, sit poor springs and gullies"", lying travelling in the Divine Kingdom.

In the series he uses images of architecture as brush strokes. The impressive mountain rocks are a reference to landscape paintings (so-called shanshui 山水 'water and mountains' paintings) from the Song dynasty (960-1279), an absolute heyday of Chinese painting, to which many references are also made in later dynasties in terms of style/subject. On the one hand, Yang Yongliang discusses urban development, which makes life in the city flourish. On the other hand, this urban development also holds life captive.

Both in terms of iconography and detailed structure, Phantom Landscape III is strongly reminiscent of Chinese landscape paintings, such as those represented in the NMVW collection. The grandeur of nature is central to these paintings. Yang's work is strongly in line with this tradition. When Phantom Landscape III is seen from a distance, it appears as if there are trees on the misty mountain cliffs. As the viewer gets closer, it becomes clear that the trees are in fact construction cranes and electricity pylons. Upon closer inspection, the mountain rocks also appear not to be rocks, but mountains with buildings. Using photography, Yang reinvents Chinese landscape paintings. He does this in a sharp way. In Phantom Landscape III he looks critically at the grand urban landscape. The detailed images that Yang creates aim to draw attention to what he sees as major social issues: environmental pollution and urbanization. The photos also include stamps (in red), which at first glance resemble the traditional seal impressions that artists and owners put on Chinese paintings with red ink. But upon closer inspection, these red stamps appear to be patterns from manhole covers that Yang has found in cities."

We have never been so close, shaking hands with each other through a piece of jade. You have returned to your roots, dust to dust, and only this jade mantle is as warm as ever. Spring Water Jade, made of tremolite, was made and worn by northern nomads in the 10th century AD. The front of the object depicts a swan, its neck (gěng) curving into an arc, its body floating and rising, its brightly coloured feathers spread out like a dance. But look closely, its head perched on top of a falcon, which is the Haidongqing. This is the Haidongqing, which hooks onto the swan's scalp, aiming its beak at the swan's eyes, and can end the swan's life with a single chirp. The swan obediently and calmly accepts its fate of certain death, with its beak slightly open, seemingly emitting a wail. The cruelty of the jade carving's subject suggests the wanderlust of the wearer's environment. At that time, due to the monsoon climate, nomadic herdsmen such as the Khitan and the Jurchen maintained the custom of hunting in all seasons and had no fixed place of residence. The ancestors built bows and arrows, domesticated eagles and dogs, and fished and hunted in the mountains and forests, producing Spring Water Jade featuring a migratory bird seizing (hú jué) a swan, and Autumn Mountain Jade featuring a tiger, a deer, and a mountain forest. Spring fishing in the water, autumn hunting in the mountains, born in heaven and earth, returning to nature. These animal images were once worn on the waists of the ancestors a thousand years ago, sewn onto people's shoulder sleeves, and became part of their bodies. When the wind rose, people danced. When a deer was painted on the shoulder, the shoulder became a mountain; when an eagle was carved on the waist, the waist became the sky. They compared themselves to the Haidongqing, celebrating the spirit of self-improvement of their ancestors and clansmen. What had surged in this jade pendant was the body heat of the ancestors a thousand years ago, and it would feel warm even after looking at it for a long time. Who flew in the sky and who was trapped in the jade? Who captured the swan, and who was captured in eternity? Who stretched out his claws and grasped the head that was meant to be one? Who spread their wings and swept over the spring breeze that has been gone for a thousand years? Life never ends, it just keeps beginning.

In Europe, this green pottery is mainly known as celadon. A peony is depicted in the center, a symbol of spring. The bowl dates from the Southern Song period (1127-1279) or Yuan period (1279-1368).

Longquan is an area in South China's Zhejiang province. Since the Song period, much pottery with a sea-green glaze has been made here. Although celadon has been produced in many different areas over the centuries, the name Longquan has come to be used as a collective name for this type of pottery.
In Europe, Longquan pottery was introduced in the seventeenth century. At the time, the pastoral novel L'Astrée by the French writer Honoré d'Urfé (1568-1627) was very popular. The hero in it, the shepherd Celadon, is dressed in a sea-green cloak. The European name 'celadon' is derived from this figure."

Empty kitchen to cook cold dishes, broken stove burning wet reeds. On the Cold Food Festival, a day when everyone eats cold food, Su Shi stewed a pot of hot vegetables. He looked up at the sky, the crows with paper money, the emperor is far away from the nine heavens, the ancestral graves are separated by ten thousand miles, want to follow the example of Ruan Ji, for the poor cry, but the heart has been as dead as ash, and then blowing can not afford. Dong Po put aside the pen, let the generations in his draft of this stamp writing. Cold food post several times into the Royal Household, three times by fire and stray into the folk. 1000 years of time into a few ink, a few parties of sealing clay densely stamped, like the descendants of the finger poke out points, the calm of that year has become the last sigh of the sigh. Huangzhou cold food post is the disillusionment of Su Shi's political ideals, but also the beginning of Dongpo's frank life. Hanging needles, variations, flying white, pulling silk, pile of ink, at this moment the poet's flesh is extremely trapped, but the spirit is unlimited soaring. Even if he is full of experience, how many people can write without dust? Even if the talent is high, and who is naive. 1000 years, Dong Po has left, fingertips flow of words become the continuation of the philosopher's life. Nearly a thousand years of time into dozens of grams of paper, to complete the purification of the meaning of life. People read Dongpo's poems, write Dongpo's words, eager to wear transcendence from ordinary life, looking for poetry from the disappointment, but how many people understand and so on Su Shi, read and understand the Yuanfeng five years of the Cold Food Festival.

Inscriptions: The Yellow River flows far up the frontier among the white clouds, A lonely city stands on a mountain of ten thousand feet. Why should the Qiang flute blame the willows? The east wind rarely passes through Yumen Pass. English: Vertical: Passing the frontier. In the far distance the Yellow River climbs to the white clouds; A lone town is perched in the mountains many thousand feet high. Why should a Tartar pipe mourn for willow trees?

83,"Song Engraved Copy Of ""Mr Changli's Collection","I am a moth-eaten fish, I have existed on earth for 300 million years, but the history of my territory is only 1,000 years. This is my kingdom, twelve lines of longitude and two lines of latitude, not a vast area, but enough for me to wander. I often patrol the borders, crawling along the ink lines, and occasionally lying flat in the sun. By the way, moths are bookworms. On a dark and windy night, I sneak into this sweaty room. Textbooks are knowledge to you humans, but food to us bookworms. The Collected Works of Mr Chang Li, this book is not good, there may be peppercorns hidden in the pulp. Yuck, spicy I straight spit out my tongue, this paper is also too hard, Fuzhou castor seed copy Qingjiang paper, almost chipped one of my incisors. Song engraved with mulberry paper, bamboo paper, cocoon paper. I overheard a person said, Song carved this paper firm carving soft, cut, this good paper made of this hard, no way down the mouth. I wandered, the night gave me a black head, I will use it to chew books in the dark. Hunger made me go farther, to the North Pole of the territory, man called him ""head of the sky"", I went to the South Pole, man called him ""foot of the earth"".

If you look closely, the name of the engraver is in the seam. Hey, Qian Gong, don't be shy. Stand up. The audience is watching you. Sun Yuan, stand up straight. Don't get worn out. I pondered that for a long time, human beings have always loved to compete. They carved characters from bones, split bamboo to make janitorial texts, bells and pans, and made rituals and music. They reproduced, they described the spherical world in block letters, they made paper, they invented the printing press, they typed and they broadcast, they accessed the internet, they voice input, they AI recognition.

The name of the instrument is always stated in Chinese characters. According to the inventory of Royer's museum from 1816, the paintings included an 'elaborate Memorie MSS in French for explanation' (unfortunately not preserved). The paintings, the memorial and the 'real' instruments in Royer's museum formed a fairly extensive documentation of this area.
[In 1876, Royer's collection was re-inventoryed in the Royal Cabinet of Rarities. Nos. 365 and 366 (these trompe-l'oeil paintings) were initially not found. They were later registered as numbers 7899-7913 in the inventory book as paintings whose provenance was no longer known.

85,Ruihe Painting,"In the year of Zhenghe Yuanchen, I had been on the throne for 12 years. The first month 15 on the second day of the Yuan Festival at dusk, the Imperial City, the end of the gate was suddenly shrouded in auspicious clouds, under the low reflection of the haze, the lofty gate tower as if the heavenly fairy palace in general, the people have to stop, look up to see, at this time, a group of cranes suddenly arrived, two of them standing in the ridge of the temple on top of the scops owl, leisurely and leisurely, looking forward to a sense of fondness. The rest are circling in the air, or fly or show, or rest or song. Different postures, no one the same. They are elegant and handsome, the group is like Xuan Gui, near and far, the size of the spirit of the ten thousand directions. In the sky, the sky was as green as the rain, and the cranes danced as if they were in tune with the rhythm. The people and officials were all amazed, and refused to leave until the cranes flew to the north-west and dispersed in the sky. I was so touched by this crane ceremony that I must write down this moment and draw it with my own hands, so that the people of the Song Dynasty will know that it is so real. As the saying goes, ""The light dawn is flickering with colourful neon, and the immortal bird of prey is suddenly coming to the ceremony. Wandering loud and clear when Dan Que, so that longing common people know. Jin of the Song Dynasty, even a stone with magic, the Royal Court in this piece of Xianglong stone, it meanders the momentum, as if the dragon. When it rains, the stone is still out of the water vapour, which is the top of the dragon in the clouds. I have twice written the Southern Dynasty Thousand Character Script, which is quite to my liking.

I love to write books and paintings, I set up a painting academy to lead the fashion, such as auspicious clouds, such as cranes, so that all kinds of auspiciousness to become a common scene in the Song Dynasty.

This painting was created by the Qing scholar Zhu Jiyi. It was engraved into a stele in the 19th year of the Emperor Kangxi (1680 A.D.) and the stele is now kept in the Xian Beilin.

The pine and crane have been a popular theme in Chinese painting, as they symbolize longevity. The pine is a perennial evergreen tree which is able to survive in very cold weather. And the crane's lifespan can reach up to fifty or sixty years.

This painting of pine and crane is drawn with much refinement and has been delicately carved onto the stele. It can be regarded as one of the most important art pieces on this theme."
86,The Cloud Platform at Juyongguan,"In 1342, at the age of 22, Yuan Huizong passed through Juyongguan Pass. Looking at the dangerous mountains and rivers, the young emperor had mixed feelings and decided to build a crossing stupa here. The stupa's base, known as the Yuntai, was designed by four Tibetan engineers to straddle the throat between the plains and the plateau. The wind rises outside the gate and the clouds surge inside. Directly above the coupon gate squats a bird with a round belly, a golden-winged roc. On either side of the roc, whales, dragonesses, virgins, beast kings, and elephant kings line up in order to hold up a sculpted sky. The cloud platform is both a platform and a scroll of Buddhist scriptures. On the inner side of the courtyard gate, the seal-carved dharani sutra and the merit tablet for the construction of the pagoda are recorded in six scripts, namely Chinese, Tibetan, Uyghur, Xixia and Bastba, demonstrating the attitude of Emperor Huizong of the Yuan Dynasty who wanted to unite different languages and ethnic groups.Over the past 700 years, some of the scripts have become more profound in the course of being read over and over again; while some of the scripts have drifted into the wind in the midst of being forgotten over and over again. Yuntai has no clouds but has rain, Yuntai has no words but has a voice. In the north, the Heavenly King of Many Wonders lifts his umbrella, in the south, the Heavenly King of Growth swings his sword, in the west, the Heavenly King of Wide Eyes subdues the long serpent, and in the east, the Heavenly King of Holding State plays his lute. In the long run, how many warriors have walked under this Cloud Terrace, how many loyal souls have been buried, how many triumphal songs have been played, and how many charges have been witnessed. Juyongguan ditch, a 20-kilometre long narrow road, when the narrowest place only allows a car to pass. Juyongguan is an important ancient pass along the Great Wall. The boundary between farming and nomadic pastoralism has been the scene of many wars since ancient times. Nowadays, the wheel has run over the footprints, the pass has become a thoroughfare, and time has dyed the alabaster yellow. Soldiers like flower petals withered, the platform is not in the clouds, because people look up to be in the clouds. Because of the wishes formed by different nationalities and languages, peace was made together. At that time, people placed a volume of Buddhist scriptures in Juyongguan and prayed that the world had no barriers",RV-462-1,Miniature landscape,"Miniature landscape of vitrified and colored porcelain; high brown rock with some buildings around it; a pagoda and many trees and flower vines along the sides.

Pagodas, or (bao)ta in Chinese, originated from the combination of Chinese multi-storey wooden towers, which were already constructed during the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), and the idea and design of the stupa, the Buddhist tomb structure for the remains or relics of saints to be venerated, originating from India. Over the centuries, the pagodas in China became much larger and more solid due to the use of stone as a building material.
In addition to Buddhism, pagodas in China also play a role in fengshui, Chinese geomancy, and the control of geomantic influences in the immediate vicinity of residential areas. The latter partly explains their numerous presence in the Chinese landscape.

In China, mountains are considered the connection between heaven and earth. Mountains are therefore closely associated with immortality and longevity. In Chinese gardens and parks we often see imitation mountains of boulders with temples and pagodas surrounded by water in the form of streams, waterfalls and ponds. Such a cultivated garden is a representation of the world but also of paradise in miniature. For example, mountains and water symbolize the Daoist paradise consisting of Mount Penglai rising from the sea.
We see the world or paradise depicted in miniature not only in parks and gardens but also, as here, in ceramics. Landscape miniatures made of ceramic, wood, jade, stone and water all aim to bring humanity's desire to enter paradise closer."
87,The Heavenly Court: Daoist Temple Painting in China,"What are the gods like? The face of the wall in silence, a moment to raise the hand holding the pen, the line from the tip of the pen slowly outflow, such as the river in the earth stretches out. Originally empty white walls, in an instant full of wall wind movement, sky clothes flying. In the manuscripts of paintings handed down from the Tang and Song dynasties, the sash still flutters. In an instant, as if the curtain of a stage is drawn, the clouds open up and the light fills the dusty walls. Nearly 300 gods and goddesses take their places on the 400-square-metre mural stage, with eight 3-metre-high emperors and queens occupying the centre of the procession, leading the congregation on a pilgrimage to pay homage to the First Heavenly Father. This is the scene known as the ""Pilgrimage to Yuan Tu"". The gods and goddesses who are in charge of all things in heaven and earth as well as earthly woes and blessings have a human appearance. At this time, the sun and the moon no longer take turns to appear, but walk side by side, with the five stars following closely behind the sun and the moon. Here they take the form of civil officials, military generals, old men and maidens. The familiar seven stars of the Big Dipper possess a young and handsome appearance. The stars overhead were silent, but they became old and young men and women with different personalities in people's eyes. Suddenly lightning and thunder, then with the daunting role of the four eyes, the four saints of the north, the figure of kui, face fierce, as if a pause, a roar, the earth is going to quake for it. The gods of the earth also tear absent from the event. The five mountains also dressed in imperial coronation, solemnity and majesty at the same time. And when our eyes and a robe on the immortal mountain encounter, only to be surprised that just looked up to the mountains and rivers of the gods is only a theatre player. Painter is like a conductor, brushwork or brisk and smooth, or staccato powerful, resulting in the face of Guanxian glamour, the wind fluttering long line, harmonious and elegant colours, interpretation of the intoxicating and déjà vu moments. The jade maidens and magi wear treasures that never lose their lustre, and the flowers and fruits used for offerings escape the fate of wilting or rotting.For 700 years, the Yongle Palace has always been a model, a visual miracle that remotely connects to the divine splendour of the saint of paintings, Wu Daozu, and also enlightens generations of folk craftsmen, and ultimately, the look of the gods and goddesses spreads all over the mountains and rivers and illuminates countless shrines and Taoist temples. The huge procession, moving steadily through time and space, is like heaven and earth in motion, with all things blowing together by suction. Though everything is like a theatre created by a painter, we still hear the fluttering of earthly garments and the breathing of the universe.",WM-29690,Carved wall painting,"Carved wall painting probably from a temple, depicting a Chinese Buddhist bodhisattva, someone who has progressed so far on the road to Enlightenment (Nirvana) that one could can achieve, but out of compassion for living beings refrains from assisting them."
88,Statue Of A Maiden In The Hall Of The Holy Mother Of God At The Jin Ancestral Temple,"1,000 years ago, she moved into a great hall, six rooms deep and seven rooms wide, a luxury she hadn't imagined. There are also plaques that make your neck sore. At the foot of Hanging Jar Mountain, where the Jin River originates, is the Jin Ancestral Hall, dedicated to Ji Yu, the first vassal of the Jin state in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Perhaps just the sculptor in the crowd took a look at her, she is not a great beauty, small eyes, small mouth, eyebrow spacing is a little wide, slightly lower nose, a timid gooseneck face, even though the most popular bun, waist hanging a tapestry ring, thin shoulders can not hold up the silk, satin slipped off, seeming childish and uneasy. The undisputed protagonist is seated in the centre, wearing a flower crown and wide-sleeved cape, which is the trademark attire of Song Dynasty noblewomen. Some say she is Yi Jiang, the mother of Tang Shu Yu. In the main hall, they are 42 attendants serving the Holy Mother together, lively as a grand theatre. The female official in charge of silver money is so majestic that people dare not approach her. The official in charge of the seal stood steadily at one side, and the little girl who had just entered the palace looked around, seeing everything new. The long time into the palace female officials coldly look at the void, a stomach of complaints. Opera singer, one side of the smiling face to welcome people, the other side slightly bitter. Wearing men's clothing with fu head of the female officials, holding a make-up box, smiling without words, the heart of the matter does not say. They stood, watched, and played dumb with us. The delicate features, the subtle emotions, hint at the drastic change in the concept of sculpture at the time of the Tang and Song dynasties. From glorifying the greatness of God to portraying the human psyche, from looking up to the divine to gazing at human nature, ordinary people became the subject of sculpture's passionate expression. Starting from empathising with the joys and sorrows of ordinary people, we rediscover the meaning of life. These sculptures, taken from the images of the Song dynasty, are a true record of the joys and sorrows of the people of that time, and their faces are clear to this day. The maid with the handkerchief is just an inconspicuous existence among these 43 people, with wood as her skeleton and mud as her skin. There may be countless stunning moments in her life, but ultimately only this moment remains, ordinary and beautiful. Curious you, calm you, nervous you, you are not the dailies of the gentle, not the template of other people's fantasies. 1000 years, the shoulders fall into the dust and ash, the image of these maids of honour, is not counted as the most beautiful face of that era, but because of their faces created the era of beauty.",RV-360-6,Statue of a official woman,"This statue shows a seated woman dressed in semi-official garb. Her hairstyle and clothing indicate that she is the wife of a high-ranking official. The statue is made of paper dough, a mixture of paper and clay.

Women did not hold official, public positions in pre-People's Republic China. Therefore, there were no strict dress codes for women. If a woman appeared in public with her husband, she matched her clothing to his. The woman's clothing bears a striking resemblance to the clothing of the statue next to it.

I have a round face with large drooping ears and a charming smile. The hair bun on my head can be removed. There is also a beautiful belt with floral motifs engraved on the waist and drooping spikes. If you remove my head, you can see that the inside of my body is hollow. Oh, why can my head be removed at will? Yes, because I'm what you call a tool man, a tool man for training doctors. All this white text on my body is the names of acupuncture points. There are over three hundred acupoint fans and over six hundred acupoints in all. These acupoints are connected to small holes in my body. The higher parts of the earth are the mountains and market hills, the depressions form valleys, and the places where the water stops are pools, as the water flows to the sea. The place of access is the road, the place of settlement is the capital, the place of concentration of wealth and population is the mansion, and the spacious and bright apartment is called the hall. A spacious, brightly lit apartment was called a hall, and the doorway in front of a hall was called a court. The aisles beyond the hall are called corridors. These points all over the body, as if the sky, earth, people composed of the magical world of landmarks, control the operation of the chakra, connecting the body's various organisations, a thought or sit still, has come and gone in the world of Qiankun. This is my predecessors in the Han Dynasty used for acupuncture lacquered wooden mannequins, they will be set up with dozens of small holes in the body, which can be used for needling or acupuncture. I have continued the function of this medical tool mannequin. In medical school exams, the examiner would cover my whole body with yellow wax, cover up the small holes and writing names, and inject water or mercury into my body. The medical student would prick the point with a needle according to the question given, and if the prick was accurate, the water or mercury mark would flow out and the question would be answered correctly. If the prick was not accurate and the water or mercury did not flow out, the wrong question was answered. I can make everyone remember the location of each point, the depth of the needles, my presence.

90,Plum Vase With Xiao He Chasing Han Xin Under The Moon,"That year, I came to the ferry, and a riverbank, drawn with a brush, stopped me in my tracks. I looked at the white porcelain, painted with a few strokes of water swirls, a small boat floating on a stream, the boatman's bare forehead and moustache, symbolising his imposing presence, all but a performance drawn in paint. Xiao He chases Han Xin under the moon, a Yuan opera, and I am the painting in the play, a scholar painted in Suma Liqing, to get into a boat painted in Suma Liqing. Behind him, an official painted in Suma Liqing rides after him. They told me to watch the play, and according to the script, Xiao He will recover me, and I will be reused by Liu Bang, ascend the altar and establish the Han Dynasty, and my name will go down in history. The cunning rabbit and the dog will cook, the bird will hide the bow and finally die from the chaos of the sword. I read my life's destiny in ten seconds and suddenly felt a sense of desolation. I, Suma Liqing, play the role of Han Xin on this porcelain vase. I am a shovelful of earth from Persia, and my chemical composition is cobalt oxide. I am a mineral from West Asia that has settled in Jingdezhen. Kaolin clay is abundant here, and this formula produces a stronger bottle. This bottle is top-heavy, with a small opening at the top, so called because of its small mouth, which only leads to a plum branch. I, Suma Liqing, he, kaolin, two countries separated by thousands of miles, reached a common understanding in the form of a porcelain bottle. Yuan Qinghua, our new name. After 1300 degrees Celsius firing, and the test of fire, we do not distinguish between us. The blossoming of a lotus petal, the entanglement of a bunch of curly grass. From a set of exotic geometric patterns to a Chinese copper coin with a round square hole, the twining branches of the Middle Kingdom and the exotic lotus are linked by a thread of the painter's finger. The conch brings the sound of the sea breeze, the ivory brings the call of the wilderness, the mani beads bring the light of Buddhism, and the gold collars signify the hope of abundance. Pine, bamboo and plum are strung together to form the gentlemanly character of the Three Friends of the Year, and are written in a sad prose. The precious flower is a verb, blooming the Buddha's wish. The blue of the Islamic world and the revered white of the Mongols are embedded in millimetres of high and low, and this is us. Cymbidium, the flower of the world, the flower of the world, from a handful of earth to a piece of blue and white pattern, blue sky and white clouds, when looking up to the sky, people will forget the weapons in their hands for a while, unconsciously leaning their shoulders together.

Our fingers are not only for pointing fingers, but also for writing poems.",RV-2551-2,A vase,"This vase with lid is part of a so-called cabinet set. It is decorated in blue underglaze. This means that the drawing is baked into the glaze. The image of a tall, slim Chinese woman can be found on many Chinese export goods. In Dutch vernacular she is called 'long ice'. There is a lion on top of the lid. The Kangxi period mark is applied to the bottom. This means that the vase was made between 1662 and 1722.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the VOC brought entire shiploads of blue-and-white Chinese porcelain to the Netherlands. In the Dutch interiors with black and white floor tiles, Persian carpets and oak furniture, the blue and white looked good. This can be seen in paintings from that time.
The so-called cupboard sets were popular: these were sets of two or more matching vases that were placed on top of a cupboard. They were there for decoration, but sometimes served as a secret hiding place for money or other valuables."
91,Painted Clay Statue Of Guan Yu,"Who are you? Guan Yu. General of Shu, Marquis of Hanshou Ting. So why is it that from the time of the Three Kingdoms to the present, people have kept their original perceptions of their elder brother Liu Bei and their third brother Zhang Fei? Only you have become Lord Guan, Master Guan, Bodhisattva, True Lord, Guan Emperor, Guan Saint, have you heard of any of these names? No, how tiring. Then I'll say it, you listen to it, and think about the beginning. In fact, more than 500 years behind you, your persona is still that of a valiant military general.

For example, Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty compared himself to Liu Bei, and the mainstream value shifted from ""embracing Cao"" to ""honouring Liu"", and you, who can handle swords and read the Spring and Autumn Annals, were promoted again, and even began to split into two figures, one for literature and the other for martial arts, and you'll have your first big identity step soon. Thanks to Emperor Shenzong, the Taoist-minded son of Emperor Song Huizong, he first named you ""Chongning Zhenjun"", giving you a considerable position in the divine hierarchy. And after a few years, he felt still not powerful enough, then added the title of ""Wuan Wang"". You were finally promoted from ""Marquis"" to ""King"". What happened to you in the Yuan Dynasty was a bit like a roller coaster. Although the court was cold, but in the people's literature can read the scriptures, martial arts can kill the enemy, you began to become a representative of the spirit of loyalty, righteousness, benevolence and courage. Eventually, written in the late Yuan and early Ming Dynasty, ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" made you a household name, but also with the Chinese fight out of the country and into the world. During the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty, you were named the ""Emperor of Loyalty and Loyalty for the Protection of the Kingdom"", and were successfully promoted to the rank of ""Emperor"".

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Western trading companies rented two- or three-story trading houses and residences (hongs) from Chinese merchants in Canton for the trading season. These so-called factories were located on the Respondentia Walk along the Pearl River, outside the walled Canton. The Chinese authorities strictly ensured that Westerners only stayed around their factories in the so-called Concession District and were not allowed access to the city. Foreign merchants could only trade through the so-called Co-hong, a kind of Chinese state guild in tea, silk or porcelain. The Co-hong had the monopoly to trade in these products and were in turn responsible for collecting taxes, renting out the factories and controlling the Westerners. The trading season usually lasted about six months, from August to January. Well before the monsoon winds changed direction in February, the western ships wanted to be on their way back to Europe. Those who stayed behind during the months when no trade took place visited their wives and children in Macao.
This painting depicts the Pearl River with various boats and the quay with the western factories. The countries of the trading companies that were trading at that time can be easily identified by the flags that are clearly outlined against the (empty) sky. To the left of the western factories, a light flag with Chinese characters flutters. This means the site of a Chinese hong with Chinese warehouses. To the right of the non-Western district - clearly separated by a high wall - we see from left to right the Danish flag, the white flag of the French royal family, the Swedish, the English and the Dutch flag. The Creek Factory building can just be seen to the right of the Dutch building. This factory was named after the adjacent river of the same name, which ran parallel to the western city wall of Canton. 
There are three clear indicators for the dating of this painting from around 1780. These are the white French flag, the Chinese warehouses and the porches and balconies of the English and Dutch factories. After the French Revolution, the white flag was replaced by the French tricolor from 1790 onwards. The warehouses were increasingly replaced by Western-style buildings later in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This painting depicts the projecting part of the portico of the English factory with a single roof on open columns. Later, in the eighties, the narrow portico was replaced by a portico three times as wide with closed arches on columns. In this painting, the Dutch factory has a single extension on the ground floor. This building was doubled in height in the early 1980s.
On the far right of the row of factories, to the right of the river 'the Creek', a hong is depicted on wooden poles. Also visible on the far left is a Chinese hong with wooden poles in the water.
A gate is visible to the left of the French factory. This gate led to New China Street. In this street, just like in Old China Street and Hog Lane (immediately to the left of the English factory), Western traders bought their private trade. Furthermore, Europeans found painting studios in these streets where they modeled and had a portrait of themselves or their loved ones painted. They also sought entertainment in the opium dens and tea houses there.
A number of figures are depicted on the quay. Westerners are visible greeting each other. The Europeans can be recognized by the headgear and long overcoats they wear. The long hair and the servant with a parasol walking behind them give away the rest. The Chinese depicted can often be recognized by the harness they wear. Chinese porters transported every export item imaginable, from the shops in the streets of the Concession District, via the factories, to the boats. There is a single dog visible and exactly two trees. A number of men in white long robes are depicted between the English and Dutch factory (priests?). They appear to be talking to each other.
Small cargo boats lie side by side on the quay. These boats usually sold all kinds of merchandise such as lumber (trusses), stone slabs, coal, rice, oysters, vegetables, fruit, etc.
In the left foreground and in the center of the painting are three colorful Chinese seafaring merchant ships. The aft deck extends above the water. An eye is painted on the prow. On these types of ships from the eighteenth century, an eye with a pupil staring forward was painted on both gangways. This was probably an attempt to imitate the fish or the eye was inspired by the superstition that the ship can see ahead in this way and thus avoid dangers. These types of ships were mainly used for the transportation of merchandise and the transportation of various products to the various provinces and ports of the Chinese Empire. This type of ship was also called red-headed ship or big-eyed cock. 
A chop boat under sail is visible in the center front. These types of boats in particular sailed between Whampoa and Kanton. At the front of the painting, right of center, two rice barges are depicted at anchor.

The boats show cast shadows in the water. A suggestion of current and movement is visible in the water, caused by horizontal wavy stripes. On the one hand, the painter has used the frog's perspective in this harbor view: the horizon is low, just above the bottom edge of the image, so that the depicted elements reach just below the edge of the image. On the other hand, a bird's-eye perspective has been used, namely that, due to the high vantage point, the viewer appears to be looking down on the performance. The high sky shows little depth and pattern.

This painting bears a resemblance to 360-1116, the rear glass painting The Quay of Canton. However, they are not identical. The trading companies present are not the same in both paintings. Spain (actually the Philippine Trading Company) is represented on the back glass painting. However, the American flag is not yet depicted in either the back glass painting or the oil painting. This means that both paintings can be dated before 1784. The flags on the back glass painting are fluttering on the left side: the wind is from the east. In the oil painting with a view of the Kanton quay with the flagging factories, the wind comes from the west and the flags blow to the right.

Harbor views
At the end of the seventeenth century, foreign powers were again welcome in China to trade. The southern Chinese city of Canton was one of the most important trading centers. In the mid-eighteenth century, all foreign trade, except that of Russia and Japan, was centered in this port city. From the mid-nineteenth century, other ports such as Shanghai, Amoy (Xiamen) and Hong Kong also became popular as trading ports. Before the opening of these so-called Chinese treaty ports (Treaty of Nanking, 1842), a group of paintings of four harbor views was particularly popular with Western traders. These were Macao, Bocca Tigris, Whampoa and Canton. The structure of the trading system between 1750 and 1842 was arranged in such a way that these four places were important places for all foreign ships. After arriving at the Pearl River delta, the foreign ships first had to find a local guide who could guide them into Macao because of the dangerous waters. In Macao the captain had to apply for a trade license and a pilot to direct the ship to the customs station at the mouth of the Pearl River, called Bocca Tigris. With this guide from Macao on board, the customs of Bocca Tigris checked the ship's papers and counted the crew and armament. Once everything was right, two Chinese guards came on board to escort the ship further up the river to Whampoa. Whampoa was the specially designed anchorage for all foreign trading ships bound for Canton.
The content of the set of these four harbor views changed after other harbors opened in 1842. Later, the image of Bocca Tigris was exchanged for that of Hong Kong harbor or the set was expanded by two paintings to a set of six, including Shanghai and Hong Kong.
It was understandable that VOC governors, commanders, merchants, lieutenants, skippers and other men on board a Western seagoing vessel took home a souvenir from the Chinese ports. But - because of the high quality with which they were made and the context in which they were obtained - it does not do justice to the harbor views to see them purely as 'souvenirs'. The purchased painting also symbolized an arduous sea voyage, a major commercial venture and contact with the great and fascinating empire of China.

Unfortunately, little is known about concrete examples that formed the basis for the designs for the oil paintings of the Chinese ports and which were subsequently produced in series (mass production) by anonymous painters. All kinds of Western engravings and prints were undoubtedly known to the Chinese painters in Canton. Such as the prints of the Jesuits and the court painters in the sixteenth century, the sketches of artists on board Western East Indiamen, for example those of the Swede Carl Gustav Ekeberg (1716-1784) and the draftsmen in the companies of Western diplomatic delegations, such as Joannes Nieuhoff (1618-1672). It is known that Cantonese painters also copied each other's work. An exact prototype for the harbor views in the Museum of Ethnology is not known.

It also combines a number of sculptural techniques, with the Guanyin's face being moulded and the celluloid on her clothes being plastered.

Water and moon goddess of mercy, is the image of the localisation of buddhist art, it is not only the object of worship, but also because of its self-clear state and the world to appreciate.

The bodhisattva Guanyin, 'The One who cares about cries [from the world]', is known in India as Avalokiteshvara, the 'Lord who looks down [from heaven]'. A bodhisattva is a buddha in the making: someone who has followed the same path to Enlightenment as the Buddha, but forgoes the final step in order to help other people achieve that Enlightenment.
In China, Guanyin is one of the most popular Buddhist deities. She is worshiped as the goddess of mercy and compassion. When someone is in need, beset by illness, pain or adversity, he turns to the Guanyin. She is also the appropriate figure for requests for prosperity, protection against evil or a numerous - male - offspring. Moreover, Guanyin is the patroness of sailors."

99,Yinzhen Ploughing And Weaving Album,"On the day of the Mangzhong, Yinzhen (yìn zhēn), the Fourth Son of the emperor, sat on the edge of a field and laughed and joked with the farmers in front of him. His feet are in the soil, which is connected to the countryside and nurtures the Chinese farming civilisation. The seedlings in his hands are 10,000 years after the first rice planted in the land of China ripened. During these 10,000 years, people have mastered the correlation between the laws of the sun and agricultural production, observing the sun, moon and stars, and the seasonal weather to predict the year's harvest. A year's farming begins with the soaking of seeds. The seeds of rice are placed in bamboo cages and soaked in running water. With the warmth of the spring breeze and the spring rains, the land is ploughed, harrowed, loosened and the ground levelled. Spring came early this year, and farmers barefootedly sowed seeds and chatted in the rice fields. In the misty spring rains, the weather gradually warms up, waiting for the rice to sprout. It's hard to imagine that the Four Aces have authentically applied fertiliser. A month later, the seedlings are to be transplanted into the paddy fields, and the farming time comes. The rice with awns is planted quickly, and the seedlings are lined up one by one in rows and connected. How long have the farmers been labouring with their faces to the ground and how many unfinished tasks await them? The summer sun is like fire, the farmers try their best to weed, once, twice, three times, day after day. Finally, the rice floats out the fragrance of ripening, full of grains, and the busyness is joyful. After the autumn harvest, the work doesn't end there. The process of turning the rice into rice is tedious and tiring, and the year's harvest has to be deposited in the granary before it gets wet from rain or snow. Regularity is repetition, a cycle, a tightly knit chain, urging farmers to toil day in and day out and toil with every grain, and the picture of ploughing and weaving depicts the whole process of traditional male and female ploughing and weaving. But any accident can overturn the whole year's efforts, and to finish the whole set step by step is the best year in the era of relying on the sky to eat. Emperor Kangxi's southern tour saw the Southern Song Dynasty's ""ploughing and weaving map poem"", feeling ""clothing when thinking of the weaver's cold, food and corn when thinking of the farmer's suffering"", imperial court painter repainted ploughing map, weaving map and make poetry. Yin Zhen imitated his father to draw ploughing and weaving atlas, will be set up for the portrait of himself and jinfu farmer and sericulture woman. Between the mountains and water, village houses, wives and children to the field to send food, the old man to play with small children, chickens and dogs leisurely, everyone is well-fed, this is not exactly what you want to idyllic pastoral life? As the year draws to a close, the family kneels before the idol and prays for a good harvest. This year seems to be sparse and ordinary, but in reality, it is the ideal peaceful world. Spring is born, autumn is harvested, China grows, and it's another New Year.""",RV-360-1125,Painting of Chinese agriculture,"In Chinese agriculture, arable farming has been much more important

100,Nine Dragons,"In 1244, the Year of the Dragon, the Southern Song artist Chen Rong painted the most vivid picture of the Nine Dragons, and thirteen aeons later, we meet again with the Nine Dragons. At the beginning of the title, the artist describes himself as painting in the ""spring of Jiachen"". After a few brushstrokes, a mountain peak rises; in the clouds, a dragon's tail swings away, pulling out a scroll of a tiger's roar and a dragon's roar. The dragon is crouching in the cliff, its four claws gripping the rock, its head slightly raised, its whiskers pointing to the sky, it is gathering strength. Ascending dragon hidden in the clouds and mountains, wrapped in a darkness, the upper body curled up, as if in the test; eyes backward, looking forward and backward. Positive dragon twisted torso, straight face us, front claws outstretched, bully up exposed, abdomen exposed, a selfless king, but also the standard pattern of the chest position of the later dragon robe. Chen Rong likes wine, often drunkenly waving the brush. The rolling soaring winds of the mountains were expressed in hair-thin lines, and the wind was interspersed with ink spots, which were the artist's frenzied splashes of ink. When the wind rises and the clouds surge, at the junction of the gale and the dark clouds, a dragon looks back and roars, its four fingers gouging the pearl, revealing its murderous spirit, and seeming to be threatening the enemy who covets the pearl. The painter, or already drunk, sweeps out a swirl. Swirl a swirl out, wrist, muscle, power to show, this is a heavy sword without a stroke, but also after no one's last song. Two dragons fighting in the whirlpool, a dragon huddled, in a defensive posture; a dragon protruding forward, is wantonly provocative, the dragon's tail twisted into a bizarre arc, suggesting the gruelling battle. The dragon's tongue is slightly coloured, a wonderful finishing touch. Between the mountains and rocks, the water flows down, and the scroll runs from the air to the sea. The waves and rocks later became a template for Japanese ukiyo-e painters to imitate. In the midst of a huge wave, a dragon's head protrudes, and the waves and fury obscure the dragon's body. The waves follow the dragon's curves and undulate in a wave-like motion, and at the end of the wave bursts out fine waves, like the infinite tentacles of the sea. Then the dragon rises and rides away in the mist. Finally, a dragon perched, lying on the rocks. The reclining dragon snores, and the earth roars with grief. Chen Rong's dragon set the standard for drawing dragons for future generations. The image of the dragon was roughly defined at this moment, and the Chinese nation reached a consensus on what a dragon should look like. From then on, where there are dragons, there are Chinese people, and we are all descendants of the dragon.",RV-1905-70,Dish,"This dish is decorated with two dragons, two feng huang birds and, on the outside, four groups of lingzhi mushrooms. Dishes like these were commissioned by the emperor or given as a gift to the court as a sign of reverence and respect.

The dragon gradually became the symbol for China. The dragon, a benevolent being that rules heaven and earth, influences the seasons and the weather with his power. The feng huang, a kind of phoenix, guards the south and is also called the 'bringer of the sun'. The dragon, as the bringer of rain, and the feng huang, as the bringer of the sun, together form the most important symbol of good luck for the Chinese farmers. The five-clawed dragon is also the symbol of the emperor, while the feng huang represents the empress. Images of these creatures are depicted on the imperial couple's clothing and other attributes. For a long time, only the Imperial Court was allowed to use these images. The Lingzhi fungi are the symbols of longevity.
